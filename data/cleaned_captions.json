        "captions": "So, it is the second meeting regarding security and government growth and data science, meaning applied ML, ML Ops, and anti-abuse team meeting. That's a big mouthful, we might get a better name over time. And that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APAC. Hi Alan, glad you're here! Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk. Glad you're here. Don't make it hard to come to this meeting because it's really late for you. And maybe so, but I'm glad. Thanks for coming at least once.\n\nNews and events: I've got a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So apologies for that, but I think it's going to go down over time based on feedback. I'll work. I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group of people. This was working for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting agenda often every only rather than posting on your slack channel. I am going to be assuming that people, leaders of the team, will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the slack channel, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe next item is that anti-abuse is moving product sections from sick to data science. Data science is effectively a rename of the model ops section. So data science will include two stages, the existing model ops, which has three groups in it, which one can talk more about, and the anti-abuse stage, which only currently has one group called anti-abuse. I think at some point there are plans to split anti-abuse into two groups, but that's not in the near future, and we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of workday changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, did you want to say anything more about data science or model ops?\n\nOh, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, so everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups, applied mallops and the later data ops as part of it. Yeah, so thanks, Thomas, for continuing to compile and report on all of my teams that I'm responsible for in the engineering allocation meetings on error budgets and reliability and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neal a high five too, he does that. He does half of these now. And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff, just trying to provide your cover. And I apologize, Neal, I totally forgot you took half a day since Thomas has been doing it for so long, but appreciating you. I know you volunteered for it, and we discussed it, but I just forgot, kind of a thankless role, honestly.\n\nI volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was going to mention, I'll type this in here, but Thiago has set up container security, a bot that weekly, I think it's Mondays or Sundays, will ping the team and ask for a volunteer to go and resource that data and we just enabled it for threat insights. It's actually pretty sweet, and it just does all the work for you, Thomas, right? We don't have to ping people ourselves. So I'll put a note in there for that. Hey F is read-only, and Bill, you've got G, challenge assessment. So we had an update from Julia, the dates haven't been confirmed yet, but it'll be sometime from mid-October through till December. I think e-group sign-off is expected to be mid-December before everyone goes on holiday. They've got a draft timeline in there, but the dates, the dates aren't in the handbook yet. The big changes we're moving to do on workday, that's not available yet. I haven't seen a demo of it. I don't know what questions will be asked, but there's an optional self-evaluation which will move in to workday and the work that we do as managers will also happen in workday. At the moment, some people are using the Google Doc which is listed on the talent assessment page for self-evaluations and for the manager work, I'd suggest continuing to use those docs until we get access to workday and see what the exact differences are. Each A and J are read-only unless anybody wants to discuss them. Thomas, you get Adam K.\n\nApologies for the late live addition to the agenda on this one, but one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure. Pretty lightweight and that we're establishing a second team within Dynamic Analysis and so, issue is there where folks want to pla... (The message is truncated)"

        "captions": "Obviously couldn't ow right, so it's the SEC growth data science staff meeting which we just discussed a confidential topic and now we're going to discuss the non-confidential things. It looks like Nate, you have the first item, yeah, just a bit of news about new hires. The compliance group has a senior front-end engineer joining on November 28th. So that's our one incident tally based out of New Zealand as well, so that's awesome. And we have another, hopefully some good news next week as well.\n\nAround this, now let's keep us moving, yeah. I got next, so we voted this in Slack last week, but it's worth repeating here. So we've got a four-year work anniversary and a three-year work anniversary one for first Versatia at the garage. So they put up with us for a long time. So this is always worth celebrating. So, I'm glad they're here, so we'll consider to the meeting.\n\nMr. Earth is an outside shadow, is also a community contributor. Yes, so just news and events since we're coming up on a U.S holiday week next week. SEC retrospective, we're going to go ahead and schedule it for the week after, so that'll be November 30th or December 1st depending upon location.\n\nWe'll go ahead and do the same thing we've been doing with two sessions, so just want to give everybody a heads up that those were coming and going to be scheduled, good stuff. So, Best In Class also known as Bicotekrs for securing Governor being finalized for Q4 byproduct management with an ETF distributing them by the end of this week. Once they are, please be sure to engage on them ASAP as we want to accomplish the ones slated in Q4 wherever feasible.\n\nIf it would help, we can consider changing team priorities of the teams working on the OKRs and those not to help out. Please also continue to give PM feedback and ask questions about the OKRs and the associated epics and issues to make sure we understand the goals and ways to deliver them as iteratively and effectively as possible. It sounds a little bit scary we're getting who cares, you know, a couple weeks into the quarter, but the thing from PM is the best in class so cares are likely going to be the work already in the backlog, a subset of the work already in the backlog that we're already working on or planning to over the next two or more releases, but we don't know for sure until we see them.\n\nI'm on vacation for the next two weeks so you won't see me sharing a load of these once they're announced, which is why I'm bringing up here. Any questions or comments about that? So the TLDR here is we're talking with our product managers. What work have you got coming up for us in Q4 that you've already prioritized that relates to Best In Class? Yes, great, and then we need to choose between those and other things, we should choose those. It's, you know, it's very, very generic, you know, guidance, of course, but we don't know the details yet, so it has to be generic also if you haven't already done so please add a comment on good, bad and try on your Q3 Q3 OKRs since we're two weeks into Q4 and tag your manager for review and then close them sometime next week or so would be great.\n\nIn the hallway, you know should we invite newly created Google Groups, the new that we created for each team as optional for this meeting so that the individual contributors are more aware of this meeting in case they want to attend, to review the notes and recording. I just put a note, I didn't think it was necessary I think just putting it on the group calendar is enough. There's a lot of events on the group calendar, I want to promote the idea that any event on the calendar you can go to you don't actually have to be on the specific invite so I didn't think it was necessary. The other concern, of course, as managers we all know this if we invite people to a meeting, they feel compelled to be there, if something comes from way, people would be like oh I need to go and we don't want to create that, but we, I definitely understand we want to make sure people feel welcome, a good point. We have also learned that people ignore group calendars primarily maybe to poll and Slack to see if people want it added but to your point said this let them know just because they're invited doesn't mean they have to come, it's exactly the opposite.\n\nSo what does everybody else think? Strong opinions either way? I agree with responsive CIS points, very good, but yeah we want to advertise better, I think the Slate poll is a good way to do that, I'm happy to run that if no one else wants to, okay tell the tours thank you so I'm out next week, but I canceled next week's meeting because many of us in the U.S at least, I think Canada too, are trying to make sure to prepare for holidays so the week after I'm also out and looking for volunteers to organize this meeting. So Phil, you just I see you volunteered on this, Thomas you did too, since you just volunteered on the last month, Phil, Thomas, you want to take this one?\n\nYeah, I got it, okay, I'll do the transfer of this appropriately, I'll keep also be aware that performance indicator meeting for the second data science month is November 30th also, well am I, so please plan accordingly Phil, Thomas, and more to do, your pre-work or homework and participate sync or async as appropriate and I just want to make sure we got an ACK on all these from Phil, Thomas, and more so I already saw that thank you. Seth you have a comment about this yeah just thanks for calling performance indicator one thing to see so many acronyms being used and it's really hard to know what these meetings are about because we are overdosing on acronyms, yeah it used to mean to me Product Intelligence because I was on a team that reported to Phil but it doesn't mean that to me anymore but it does mean to that team. We have also overloaded terms as more Taylor like to remind we have two teams called data science at GitLab come on and another one and that creates confusion too good point these are interesting things if you want to look at talks about what PM's goals are and what metrics they use the engineering metrics that we're familiar with like error budget and percentage of issues that are maintenance versus bugs versus features, but the this group actually might be particularly interested in the PM metrics like usage of the systems and customer growth and I find that stuff really interesting, you might too or you might not but you're definitely welcome.\n\nPhil, you've got to cool, we have a get-together we normally have a get-together grant for the first month of the quarter because it's Q4 instead we haven't used up yearly holiday party budget, we talked with Christopher async and he is thinking of delegating that down to the sub-department level which means we'd have some flexibility in what we organize. I'm interested to hear what people in this group and your team, so please share with them and what they would like to do, do you want to do something at this level where we have maybe three meetings in a 24-hour period and we invite a lot of people, do you want to break out into smaller groups, do you want to include your counterparts a product and stable counterparts, yeah I'm interested to hear what people want to do, yeah, Carmel and the growth team they've started an issue to discuss it, to discuss what they want to do, yeah any other suggestions, yeah, for monologues we'll actually bring this up even in the team meeting and add, and probably even start an Azure report to discuss, last time obviously it was very small the team, but yeah so hopefully we'll get more details soon.\n\nAside from ordering food does anybody have any great ideas on how to cash in on that hundred bucks? Oh, um last year it was four or five, we did secret Santa and it was really interesting to see how engaging everyone was, of it was interesting definitely we did, they really wanted to know what the other person what actually want as a gift so yeah that was, that was fun. So what I'll do is I'll create one issue for this group and put some of the ideas that we've had and put examples of what we've done in the last years at various sub-department levels. I'll share it, I'll ping you all in that issue you can take it away to your teams create your own issue, decide what you want to do and we'll all come back together in a week or two and organize what we're doing we do need to check the latest guidance on what we can what you can purchase as part of the holiday budget because there was an update recently so we want to make sure things like secret center are still allowed all right look at the time and will go next it's hard to follow that up with metrics but I'm going to anyway. So, I was talking with Derek earlier this week and he's part of a working group for DevSecOps adoption and we've historically within SEC, so secure and govern, we've had a challenge with metrics and accurate metrics collection and so he's looking for an engineer to help him with that to help reconcile this particular situation, looking for a point of contact that he can work with across the section itself.\n\nSo, I was bringing this here and to find out if anyone has an engineer that might be interested in a section-wide initiative that would help that would be based within the Rails platform to help out with this and I won't look for handraisings but please consider and get back to me asynchronous whenever you have a moment, I'll be asking more later this week as well so I've been discussing this with Derek as well because there's a lot of updates needed in compliance and I have an engineer who's working tightly on that and I'll ask them whether they're willing to look at the section lead and get back to you, okay thank you sir, I appreciate it. Tamara you've got next, yep, I opened up a team or an issue for planning our section team day, still trying to figure out what the date should be, but we're thinking early in December.\n\nFirst question is would anyone like to co-host or collaborate with me on finding this out and the second question is going to be around in the past attendance has been fairly low so just brainstorming ideas on how we could improve attendance there and could be carried out ASAP as well. Sid Earth is, as I mentioned, a GitLab community contributor, any questions they said, Earth again any questions for Siddharth on like why he's a community contributor or Siddharth any questions for this group. It looks like Thomas, you've got a question for Siddharth, yeah, it's two parts um so I'll start it so thank you for joining us, so first question is how long have you been a contributor to the project and the follow-on to it is, has it been getting easier or harder to contribute so like I've been contributing to GitLab for one and a half years and like it's been a great journey Ike I've been with GitLab I've also done Google summer of food with GitLab so like it was fun and it's been a roller coaster ride so yeah like I'm enjoying contributing to GitLab yeah sure any questions for this group, I know you've met a few of the people all previously in various meetings but any questions for this group of engineering managers and senior engineering managers and legal counsel that happened to be here today, not right now but I'll let you know, like I haven't okay cool apologies that we went a good bit over on time but we had a lot to discuss and discuss a lot of good stuff so thanks everybody have a great."

        "captions": "McDonald's way, how are you doing, sir? I should announce this is the SEC growth since the data science staff meeting for January 18th. I don't know, yeah. Hey, George, hey, Wayne. Hey, Thomas. George, how are you, sir? I am good. How about you? Doing all right, and I am admiring the reimagined series of elements on the wall behind you. I've heard this comment so many times, I'm sorry. Oh, it's fine, it's fine, completely fine, it's not that actually. Yeah, but anyway, it's a design practice I used to try a while ago. So, we'll get started in about a minute, we're all early, that means everybody else is late. I say in jest since this is being live-streamed. Is it possible philosophically, is it possible to be late in all meetings? Or options, is it possible? Sounds like a quote from somewhere. I don't know, I think yes, if anyone who joins late asks people to back up in the agenda, you're actually late and you shouldn't ask for that. So, but all meetings are up. Hey, hey, how are you doing? Wayne, good, we'll get started in about 30 seconds. Did you have a good long weekend? Yeah, how about everybody else? George, Thomas, how was your weekend? Relaxing. Largely good, I just need kids to not get sick anymore. So, it's the SEC growth data science staff meeting for January 18th. We were talking about other things before we get started, but when we get started, so first, welcome George, who's my shadow this week and a GitLab core Community contributor. Hey, everyone. So, why don't we jump over to tomorrow? It looks like you're the next item. Yeah, I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Lucas and James for receiving the discretionary bonus on their efforts on a recent customer escalation. Not only Lucas and James were involved, Thiago, thank you for not only proposing the discretionary bonus but also all your efforts on this as well as Neil, who's not present. So, it's great collaboration across the stage section and other teams. I think I have the next one too under news and events. Just in case you missed it, linked to personal access tokens will now be automatically revoked for all GitLab core team members. It's a huge step in that continued trajectory of making this enabled for all customers. That's going to be happening for gitlab.com on January 23rd and as well as self-managed on the 22nd of February. Dates still accurate as of now, but yeah, just a huge shout out to everyone involved in that effort as well. Thanks, Simon. So, we've got a development newsletter that we're working on to talk about in this meeting. Before after reviewing it in Christopher's staff meeting, got some good feedback on it from a number of folks. So, the details are here as we get started on this epic, the first iteration is planned for February. If you have topics that you think should be included or you want to weigh in on the topics that are included, please collaborate on the issue for the February newsletter. Also, please make your team aware so they can collaborate on the contents if they're interested in doing so. Some have already collaborated on, which is great. I think I just posted this less than 24 hours ago. So, good stuff. Please also review draft Q10 OKRs for secure, gather, govern, growth, and data science. I put mine in earlier today and you know, please start working on ones for your teams, keeping these in mind, but also coming up with your own based on the overall themes in the GitLab values. Of course, do we want to review these live with that? We've done that in the past. Do we want to do that maybe in a Zoom? Emoji up, down, or if you want to reveal a log forward. I'm not going to share my screen because this issue is public. I put it in the chat and George, I think I said this to you as well, see you have it okay? Good. Some of the themes and I started mine based off of Christopher's, etc., but again, these are all drafts. So, objective one, increasing revenue by growing a customer-result mindset and delivering results. So, continued work on federal, government, growth, data science or AI-assisted code suggestions, MVC, and model registry, MVC, and the rest of these into this one are based off the product management issues. I think they're all in flux. I don't think product is settled on layers just yet, but that's great. We've got to really look at them to make more questions or comments about those. As I realize my issue has two objective threes so I will fix that as I talk. Do you want feedback or commentary on this issue or do you want it on agenda or do you want it in Slack? Where do you want it? How about now? Okay, do I, okay, whatever you prefer. I'll start now and I'll happily go, I'll write them where I'll write them in the issue done as well. Continuous vulnerability scanning is competing against deprecating License Finder and compositional analysis. So, I'm dubious that both can be achieved particularly during this particular quarter, particularly with 160 approaching at the very end. So, and I think License Finder replacement has the priority. And the real-time SAS, one targeting web IDE. Or the web IDE replacements. Product is saying that won't be ready for SAS until Q2 at the earliest. And so there I know I'm hearing, I hear they're not settled on that one yet like you were saying earlier. And so, but I'll put both of them in there. Yeah, just because I've been saying it in the source issue that PM's purpose are engaging some of this, but not always, so that's good to know. Good feedback. Great feedback. Objective two mature the platform to continue to be the leading DevSecOps platform. Continue to TBD iterations to close best in class gaps pending discussion of product. 100% of our teams are using GitLab as an OKR tool. You know, we're getting off. Ultimately, it's kind of an easy one for us to achieve, but important to achieve. And raising the MRI rate TBD. It's a overall development goal we want to look at ours as well. Objective three, career growth of team members. Team member training or 360 feedback cycle. Figuring that out. A hiring goal TBD to be determined. Towards assessment follow-up and action plans based on feedback. And finishing the word finish complete typo again. Complete the gap analysis and delivery to be determined short-term wins for secure, governance, growth, and data science. And lastly, under application health, error budgets and continue to burrow down the list of customer impacting S1 and S2 bugs. Generally, we made progress and we're always making progress on these, including in Q4. That's initial pattern of these. Wayne is the project of it, does it overlap with objective three K, are four, so the gap analysis and the big gap. Yeah, good point. Very good point. We need to simplify that. And where do you think it fits better? Oh, it doesn't fit that well in career. I mean, we're already doing the efforts of big growing the platform, right? So between the two, I would keep objective two K, R1. Yeah, I'm going to delete that. It's a duplicate in the wrong place anyway. Good catch before you do because I was looking at the oh, I was looking at Christopher's OKRs yesterday. I saw the after thinking, I saw I had the same question. Saga did, but I had separated them eventually in that. I think some teams haven't finished the gap analysis, and I think this is to be a follow-on to the work that's happening this quarter. Whether as 2, 2.1, is what iterations have been identified that are not the quick wins. I think they're separate though. It's fine. I'm still going to move it. That's a good point. I'm going to move it to the above one. Because it was definitely the wrong objective. Just refresh, see if that looks, makes more sense. Basically I moved up, simplified it, and moved it up from objective three, objective two. Wayne, for application health, the resolve S1 and S2, are we just looking to achieve a particular velocity on a regular basis because we'll always have bugs coming in, right? So it's not necessarily a burndown but maybe just a cap as to where we want to be or a threshold and maybe also with a focus on overdue ones. I don't know if we have any current overdue ones, but Omar, you were tracking the equivalent OKR for Q4, was that about overdue ones or any? Last I checked, there weren't any overdue once however throughout the course of Q4, like Seth mentioned, if they did pop up under S2 but they were worked through and closed down as a result and we don't want to get to zero, right? Because as Seth mentioned, they're always coming in, we want to get to zero, but we don't want to have that as a goal. It would be resolving a number of them, which would perhaps be the number we have currently and some more assuming more coming, but yeah, we'll figure that out. That makes sense, yet great question additionally, I think a focus on S3 and S4 might also be a good one because the list of US during the sprint seemed to be longer, usually always longer than this one. It is two, it looks like we're discussing this asynchronously, which is great. Please put the comments later, or not if you don't have been the Google Doc which is just fine, you know, add them to the issue that'd be great. So we're collaborating there as well for folks who didn't make the meeting or read it later, or we forget all this. Great feedback. Alright, moving on to the next topic. Can someone volunteer to verbalize? Yeah, sure. Let's see from the staff meeting looking for volunteers to contribute to the audit work efforts. This can be any M or higher. ICS can also help with the technical bits. Sam and Darva have started on this, but we could use some help for context. These efforts justify our financial audit and as such are important to the overall success of the company. More details in this document linked here. Yeah, I just went through this. I got sometime to look at this. I volunteered for one part. We're still looking for volunteers for others. So take a look, see if you're interested for you or your engineers, because there's some work that fits nicely in a people leader and some for engineers as well, some automation work. Is this a requirement just as a publicly traded company or is this just a standard business practice to have a financial audit every year? That is a great question. I don't know. Maybe I'm sorry. Kind of related, is this the audit that the auditor signs off on as part of that? Or because we also talk about audits for federal and audits for this, and audits for RubyGems, and we use the term audit quite a bit. Looking at the Christopher staffing control, is what it's about. What is ICG, I don't actually know what ICTG is equal is my friend, that's bad. My team, general controls. Great question, maybe to ask. Does a quick search look like it's part of SOCKS, which would be part of being a public company? Okay, thanks for volunteering to read those. Thomas, looks like you've got next. Alright, this is just a big thank you for me. So, particularly for everybody's participation, those weekly error budget issues, we've got a link to this week's available there from the agenda. It was my week to represent everyone here in the engineering allocation meetings that happened yesterday and the content here was hugely helpful not only in shortcutting the amount of time it took to prepare for that conversation, but also providing additional context as to what was going on. So this was a big help. So thank you for this and it's much appreciated and extremely helpful. You've got to verbalize that. I was going to, yeah, nice mustache, great moustache. I love that moustache, mate. I've been seeing it for years, I miss it when I don't see it, you know. Alexander from the moustache team is staying in my house with me and he only got this mug. I said, people are gonna ask where's Thiago and what have you done to him? So he got a different mug. If he happens to use it in a meeting, he has to join through your Zoom account. We'll let him know. Any questions for the group, George, based on what we discussed or does the group have any questions for George? George has been a core team member, community contributor to GitLab for many years. I introduced George to Tim Zolman and they said, oh, hold on a second, we've known each other for years since Tim's been around as well. So George, you have any questions for us or do we have any questions for George as a community contributor? Hello again, George. We saw each other tomorrow. How are you enjoying the experience? It's been great so far. Very informative, and I mean, I feel close to the yellow team and it feels good to be part of this process here. Do you feel like all the core members would benefit from the experience? Absolutely, yeah. I brought this initiative in the core team meeting a while ago and I will bring it up again. So maybe others may be interested in joining. Yeah, it's great having you and all this coming in. It's going to bring us closer to the community. I like it. So, welcome, one thing that George and I discussed earlier is we don't have a lot of community contributions to the secure to our stages, secure, govern, growth, and data science, compared to the other stages. And one of the reasons maybe that people like contributing to things that they use and most of our stuff, not all of it, most of it is you need a valuable license to use and a community contributor can get a valuable license to do community contribution work, but they're not going to naturally gravitate towards it unless they're already at a customer that has a valuable license. So, I don't know if this would be the only thing to increase community contributions. First off, the video, some including Dev/Full has done a lot in the past. I really appreciate him. But for multiple reasons, not just this one, is move a subset of secure features and maybe governance features as well to the open core or the open source part of the product, and rather than being binary like you can't get any of it unless you're a valuable customer, where we couldn't move too much or people would have no reason to pay, but maybe we moved just enough where the open source community gets access to those and value them and then directly they start using them and directly they have feedback on them and they can go and prove it themselves with everybody and contribute. So I know we've talked about this as a concept in the past and just figured I'd throw it in front of the group for their thoughts. Wayne, have we considered switching responsibilities onto the ultimate license? So for example, as soon as we notice a new core member contribution, we reach out and say hey, here's an ultimate license valid for whatever we're comfortable with and keep track of that and just use that to build a stronger link. Would that be taxing on us? Have we thought about it? I don't know if we thought about it but it sounds like a great idea. You mean yeah, right? George, you receive say hey, he's your ultimate, and he said what does this do? Let me go have a look. I think it's already part of the Heroes program where you know when you contribute after some time you also get the ultimate license for a group but I don't remember if it's like on the first tier or the second. Cool, maybe this is combining the ideas. Thomas, you were saying, yeah. George, when you're looking for or identifying where you're going to contribute, how do you identify that opportunity? Is it by issues? Is it by things you notice? Is it features you want? What do you, what do you, how do you look? I have multiple ways. I mean sometimes it's just something in the application that bothers me or it's like moving one pixel to the left or there's something that I'm, I'm always, always looking for migration initiatives where we migrate to the pajamas components and make the application more robust and yeah, sometimes I just go through the community contributions, take a look, what's going on, if there's anything I can help forward things to the right person or team, but yeah, like open source in some parts of the security features would be really nice because when you contribute to something, it would be nice to get something out of it or use it later. And I think in the past historically we have been open sourcing features from the premium tiers and that would be something to consider further. Thanks, everybody, have a great day."

        "captions": "Directly hey, the recording is cool, nice. So I know that you have had some discussions in the last session, which I didn't attend due to my day off, about the capacity for the UX research and communicating that to the PMs. So I'm curious, will you guys move this topic to this session? What were some of the outcomes? Where did you finish? You know, what was discussed? Basically, there was a pretty long discussion. I mean, I like multiple views and there are different perspectives on how we should manage this. So, I don't think we reached a concrete conclusion besides, yes, we need to communicate our capacity to our PMs and we need to find a good way to do that. I don't think we reached a very concrete conclusion, and I think there were still thoughts regarding this. That's why we moved it here - can I conclude that conversation? Any idea of where to start? I'm curious, how do you do this at your stage groups today? I thought more about it, and I definitely can say I was more mindful about it this way with my PMs to see how I was communicating my capacity, and I realized that maybe I don't have mechanisms to report that capacity to them, at least not until we meet and review the backlog or the roadmap. And there's like, 'okay, I can do this, I can do that,' but yeah. So I realized that maybe there's something missing, which is a clearer, more, they better visibility of my situation as it's a little bit different from group to group. So I think it's very important for them to know how things are and how one team works on one of my groups so they can plan against my work there. But still, I think there's an opportunity there to communicate more, you know, like I don't know, maybe sharing with them like aboard in Slack with all my issues. You know, maybe that could be something so they can just go look into that synchronously. But that's my idea that I had or maybe just like kind of like telling them at the beginning of the week, 'this is what I'm doing this week, I am at full capacity, expect me not to be available to work on these.' I'd be more practical, that's what I thought. Like those were the thoughts that I was having. I don't know. Who else, yeah. I was just having the discussion with Tao and both engineering managers of Steele about basically creating more visibility and what is being done for a milestone. And then we ultimately got to the point where there was a little section in the issue. She was, she's thinking of creating that displays, you know, design priorities or design responsibilities. And what I said to her back then was like, 'Hey, we need to make sure that we are not, you know, putting the design responsibilities within a time box of a milestone because that, it doesn't fit in there, some design efforts might, you know, fit into weeks while others fit into one and a half a month, right?' And with that, we got to the discussion back to a discussion-based style of working and that kind of falls in line with the validation tracking board which had been discussed in the daily UX user experience weekly once upon a time. And like a few weeks ago, I was if others already apply this. So the idea is that you have your columns of problem validation and you've got your design workflow design and Workflow Solution Validation and instead of filtering down for a milestone we filter down to your assigned tasks. You know, my issues within those columns and if one moves to the next, or one moves to planning, breakdown or scheduling, whatever it means, that a spot has opened up to some extent. That is a simplified way of looking at it because we don't individually wait for issues. I'd say our process is different than engineering but it's kind of materializes visualizes in a way, you know, 'Hey, what is the weight, what is the current effort of design at this very moment. And if something changes, let's review this, for example, weekly and say, 'Hey, these things changed versus last week, hey, something did change, the spot opened up, does this mean you can add a new issue? If so, let's already do that. Work ahead.' And that is the idea. We took a little bit of a different approach. We have a very similar like Kaban setup where there's the solution validation, the design phase of validation and working backwards. We try to coordinate and make sure that every milestone has some sort of research effort happening and we kind of look at the board and communicate about where we should focus. It tends to be a... Here's a bunch of stuff, and this is the time slot we'll add it. And I just have a commitment of making sure each thing can kind of be done in a time range and it flexes in weighing. So I will try to keep it in two milestones. But I try to reflect like the solution validation as a research effort so it takes a little longer than maybe the actual design phase might. So I'll try to prepare for the solution validation in the next one. So I think I managed my own time and reported back to Tim. I think that's the way I would explain it. So it's a lot more... I kind of just jump in and say, 'This is the research that we're doing based on what's in design and solution validation'.\n\nI am sorry, um, I tried to make sure there's just one research effort happening in a milestone. The backlog is usually emptier on my side than it is on Tim's just because it goes through the cycle so quickly once it hits design and solution validation. We're working on figuring that out. One of the things we're going to do to try to do that is 12.7. I'm going to do product validation and let him have an extra milestone to get things through problem validation. So that means that Tim does all the problem validation and you specify or you do the solution validation, unless Defa's definition as a valid... as a... defined as... I have been suggested in the meeting with Tau and both engineering managers at Steel that basically creating more visibility is being done, and later we eventua...\n\nI'm really sorry, I cannot complete the text because it exceeds the character limit."

        "captions": "My car, maybe you can... yeah, but I don't know. Where is this getting recorded to the cloud or my computer? Anyway, yeah, so I was saying that, Sa*jung I learned a lot from the process that you were following and all the learnings that came from that. So, like, we thought that it's going to be good to kick it off as soon as possible and not wait for everything to develop first and then think about where to place it. Yeah, yeah, I think this is the right way to go. Thanks for sharing. So, my item, there is pretty big and rather radical change from the cicd private catalog. So, we discussed this a lot and this came up and inspired me a lot while I did the journey map exercise. And I didn't feel it's right to have this private cicd catalog scope herein the same space because we have interviewed several self-managements customers. It could be really multiple namespaces. I'm not going to disclose the exact number, but it could be a lot. Of course, it depends on the organization size and how Dove announced this change and this will impact a bit of our product roadmap or the timeline. Design-wise, the impact is not that big, but I think this is the right way to go. So, I was really supportive about this change and yeah, you can see that now we simplify the structure. So, we will have one organization catalog and one open-source catalog that is kind of similar to The Marketplace. And I have personal updates. So, you can read through it. I might need to reschedule some of our coffee chat or one-on-one if I need to, from next week until the end of September. I wanted to share with you all. So, hi everyone. Item Emojis are not working. It's mostly Command: Control - Shift that works for me to show the model for the Emojis. I use it a lot. So, I'm not sure about storage space. Okay, so Maria is not here, so we can just go through this asynchronously. Maybe we can move to research. Yes, so, I am just analyzing all the sessions from how do we use AI to help users optimize their Runner and CI builds. And it was pretty cool. We used like a decision tree process from this book on AI that I'm reading, and basically the idea is, if you can put the decisions into clear and if-then statements, then you have support that you can automate this workflow a bit. So, we didn't know if it would be like, I think about this, but that's related to this and this is really but actually, it's like pretty straightforward anyway. So, I won't go into the results, but I'm working on the report and that'll come out. I think I'll share it with the uxr team soon and it will come out next week. But there's really good information in there about just the details that people need to make decisions and kind of the outcomes for optimizing Pipelines. And the process is very trial and error, and set it and forget it, that's the main thing. So, I think that's like one of our CI learnings. Just like the biggest thing I've learned at GitLab is that they don't think of these things in their minds, either. Like, they specialize in it, they execute it, and then they go away. But I think that there's also findings related to how to support teamwork. So, I think you'll like the report and the next week or as soon as I kind of get my mind into that report, then I'll start working on how users are using GitLab and the cloud. Do you want to ask your question? Yeah, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the effort? Yeah, so I'm actually very proud of us as a product company that we're like ready to move into this space. So, we're looking at kind of the connection points between GitLab and the cloud and like where the workflow lengths, kind of the tools that users are using, and that'll inform part of the integrations that we're building, like soon with GCP. But then also, like long-term, what works well in terms of integrating that does it. And that's actually where I think we can bring in some questions about resources and whether or not they should live at the project or the group level. Like how teams access secrets, for example. Where do those get stored in GitLab? And is it like higher up organization level? Because I'm thinking a lot about this new change that's coming related to organizations with some new modes. Because that's like the new play with the catalog, which I think is really smart, which is to put it up there. But then I'm wondering, like, what else could we move up there? Like maybe the secrets because they're at this company level. But that's what we can look into. Talking about that, Erica, can you later go and chime into the issue that I've created for navigation and share your views there? Because, yeah, we don't want even though I have mentioned about like taking it out of cicd. If there's any research that points that we should have it maybe as a part of my navigation or at a higher level in my navigation, we should be aware of that. And that would help us inform the methodologies that we would like to select for research. Okay, I think we haven't gotten that detailed because that's actually really tactical. Most of the research so far has been like, what is a secret so. But I'll look, I'll look, I'll put the lens on there but I think I won't have much. But I think from this study, we might get something. Okay. Okay, and by the way, I've also picked this up based on your recommendations. You can read that chapter three. Oh, sorry. Okay, go ahead. Oh, it's okay. I just had another follow-up question. Are you only looking at GitLab SAS users? I'm trying to read through your issue and I mentioned that because one of the teams that I work with in enablements currently, the Application Performance Group is changing their name to Cloud Connector. Okay, and they're focusing on self-managed users, essentially giving them access to like AI features and things that would be available through GitLab SAS but at the self-managed level. So that might be a good team to connect with. You know, in terms of this research. Okay, awesome. Well, thank you. Thank you. I think we landed on the stats, yeah. But either way, I think they would at least be interested in that. So helpful. Well, thank you. I'm embarrassed that I can't quickly find that issue, but it's okay. I'm on this other project. Yeah. So if you want to ping their entire group, I can list the channel there and then I can also list the PM as well. Okay, cool. I'll just put that in there. Thank you. Thank you. We're a good team. And then I have this note. I have to find it, you know. But I'm watching The Sessions again and again, so it's coming. But there's this lovely quote about how we made a change and the details people could see about the pipelines completing and this woman was like, \"I love it. I used it the other day to show my executives that I need more funding for my pipelines because I could show kind of the times and how if we reorganize things, this would impact the times.\" And then she used that to buy more of our product. So that's like the best you can put this in your portfolio. Where are we showing the pipeline summary? I'm sorry. Oh, um, well, I mean, I'm I don't know, but what she was telling me was that the new way that she can look at the metrics allowed her to make this argument. I need to pull up... I'll pull up the quote. Okay, it was Priyanka. Okay, the other updates before I go over, you know, to end the day anything that someone wants to bring up if not then this is it it's in the meeting here, bye everyone have a good one. [Music]"

        "captions": "Yeah, so I'm just going to go over some of the things that the pipeline authoring team is doing to figure out a better way to collaborate between UX, PM, and Engineering. So first off, we had lots of discussions in the retro that I started to gather feedback from the engineers on how they would like this retro, how they would like to work with UX, how they want to collaborate on issues, when they want to be included, and what is the preferred way to receive updates from UX. And our front-end engineers provided lots of very detailed feedback that really helped me better understand what the problem is and what gap exists between us. It answered a lot of questions for me and kind of opened my eyes to some of the problems that I didn't think were problems. So that was great.\n\nThere was a discussion here with some follow-up questions and stuff based on that, and based on the survey that I ran to kind of set a benchmark score. Which, I have to finish analyzing this and document the results, I ran a survey that's anonymous so I can share the results with you I think. Which was interesting because it really highlighted that there's a gap between what the engineers want and what I'm providing. Even though I felt like I'm really doing such a great job communicating all of the UX findings, I just wasn't doing it in a way that made a lot of sense to them and that was easy for them to consume. So, it turns out that a lot of the team members, the responses were from front-end engineers mostly, but also backend and also one engineering manager as well. Half of the team doesn't really feel included or excluded into the UX process. I guess they just don't really feel that much involved.\n\nAnd I kind of go over some of the most interesting results, but most participants, they didn't understand how UX research ties into our product direction and the user experience so that was interesting also. Because for me and Dove it's obvious, we know why we're doing it and why it's important, and we share it but it's just like we weren't able to really show how it ties to our product direction yet at least because, again, we're very new so I guess it's normal that we're going through this process.\n\nAnd it turns out also we weren't including the engineers early enough, specifically that goes for our front-end engineers. We would include them after we do like a first pass on a design solution or like a design proposal and from that, and from there on, we would really include them and we would collaborate with them at that point. But they felt like at that point we're already leading with some type of solution that we created based on the insights and the data and the business case that they don't fully understand. So we found that there's an opportunity for us to establish more trust. For example, for sure, and to show a more solid foundation that we already have in our heads but show it to the rest of the team of all of the UX research insights and all of the like opportunity canvases that Dove has been working on and you know, things like that.\n\nThere's also a MR where I propose some changes but there will be many more changes, mainly just like simplifying things. You can go over this MR if you're curious about what are the things that I'm hoping to accomplish in terms of UX collaboration on the team. And there's an ongoing discussion here between the engineers and the engineering managers and Job and I. If you have any comments feel free, and if you have any suggestions for what worked for you, so we're still in the middle of it today we have a sync discussion, like some of the team members are breaking up pretty early, I'm staying up late for this because it's super important. So our goal is to align on a small process change that we know will be impactful and that we will be piloting. And for now, we're thinking that we will focus on fostering async communication and async updates between engineers and UX to help us document everything better and that will solve many problems in terms of the shared understanding that we create and how accessible the information is. So yeah, very excited about this and it's been taking up a lot of my time and just kind of mental energy because it's this kind of messy human relationship thing that needs to be figured out but let's see how that works out. I think we can figure it out. Thank you for sharing this, Adia, I know that we've been talking about this, it's a recurring theme across GitLab, and I'm curious to hear also from others. I know that, Vitica, with your team, you managed to align things in I would say, a much easier way and your own boarding and you getting to know people, but yeah, I'm curious to hear with your experience and your thoughts on the survey or the results that Adia shared.\n\nYeah, I couldn't put a finger on what is going, but I'm very happy with how things are, the engineers are very responsive and they're always keeping an eye out for any new updates on the issue by me or by someone else. So the discussion part of the CI team is very healthy and it's very productive that I'm just having a hard time of taking out an actionable improvement that the pipeline authoring team could make by getting inspired by how we work because it's also organic so I couldn't really suggest something. So for my part, this last milestone 1311 was my first milestone fully as a designer in release, so for me it was rather than having an optimal process just having any process was the first time I was implementing a design process here. I already got really good feedback on how I can improve and some things I realized were not ideal so I'm going to start using Loom videos, for example, to communicate the broader design vision for an issue because just typing walls of text sometimes doesn't really work as well to communicate the meaning behind the design changes. Adia, I think it's really great how not only you had this initiative to improve the process but also you used the design process to improve the design process, that was really amazing.\n\nThe survey and everything, I'm still figuring out where to go in terms of the design process for release but I'll definitely steal some of your ideas to have better feedback in a similar way, more structured way rather than just asking \"hey, what can I improve?\" So thanks for the really good example. Yeah, I think my main learning from this whole process so far was that I should have run the survey like one week into the pipeline authoring team being born, just maybe not this exact survey but to better understand the background of all of the engineers and how they're used to working to understand what gaps to expect and what gaps to kind of predict that they will form because like this is their background and this is my background so I could adjust earlier on. But yeah, better late than ever.\n\nYeah, it's beautifully written. Let's see how the rest goes. Thank you."

        "category": "engineering",
        "captions": "Hi, this is Eric Johnson. It's February 18, 2021, and this is the Engineering Key Review at GitLab. So, I've got Number Four on the agenda, which is a proposal to break up this meeting into four department key reviews. Currently, Engineering, Development, Quality, Security, and UX Infrastructure and Support do their own key reviews. \n\nThe reasons for increased visibility are able to go deeper, increase the objectivity with which my reports can manage their groups, allow me more time to focus on new markets, and allow me to shift into more of a question-asker mode than generating content and answering questions in these meetings. \n\nTo avoid adding three yet new meetings to stakeholders' calendars, I propose we do a sort of two-month rotation. So, one month, Development, Quality, one month, Security, and UX would go. How do people feel about that proposal? I think in the group conversations it's working really well. So, I'm supportive, and this is the smallest thing. Maybe we need four meetings a month, like it's the biggest apartment, it's super essential. But you propose this, I don't. I could see it either way. So, let's stick with the proposal. Cool, we'll try it, and we can be flexible.\n\nAnd then I've got Number Five, which is we've got, RD Overall MR8, and we also have RD Wider MR8, both as top-level KPIs for Engineering. The difference between them in the simplest sense is that RD Wider MR8 includes both community contributions and community MRs. The problem I see with this are that one, the Wider MR rate, the one that includes internal and external MRs, it duplicates the overall MR, which is sorry, sorry. The Wider MR rate should just be external, right? And the overall should be arrow plus wider. Yeah, like we say the wider community, right, right.\n\nOkay, so there's, I'll have to check the taxonomy. Lily, can you confirm? That's Sid's reasoning is my understanding as well? Yeah, I believe the Wider MR rate just captures community contributions only and  no internal. Yeah, and the reason we measure that is that like one of the most likely failure modes is that we lose the community. Yeah, so Eric, where it gets goofy is that when you look at a specific team within the company, there could be contributions outside of that that aren't community contributions. They would be viewed community contributions by that group but effectively they're not from outside the company. So that's why we use Wider to kind of reflect that, and Arrow is very specific to the team. \n\nAre you saying that if someone in Plan contributes to Verify, it's viewed as wider, not quite. Plan, Plan and Verify are just fine. It's when you look at the Development versus Infrastructure. Infrastructure will oftentimes contribute to Development's work but it won't be counted as MRs.\n\nOkay, that's a potential bit of funkiness that we should talk about separately. I didn't have that in my sort of critique of this, but that doesn't necessarily make intuitive sense to me. So part of my critique of this can be thrown out because it's not as duplicative as I thought, but I still think there's a problem with RD Wider MR1, which is this thing doesn't really move in part because it's a rate. So it feels like the way to drive this up is to specifically drive community authors to contribute more than one MR per month. That's how this moves up because it's a productivity rate. Like we use internally and that doesn't necessarily feel like the right thing because there are scenarios in which this goes up, we've actually got fewer contributions overall and fewer contributors overall. \n\nWait, wait, wait a second. So you're saying that RD Wider MR rate is number MRs per external contributor? Oh my goodness, that should not be the thing. It should be contributions per GitLab team member. So the country above the division is the external ones, the thing below is the number of team members at GitLab. Is that the case, Lily? I'm checking right now. Um, I think so. International team member, so unless we start calling people outside the company team members then it shouldn't be done. Yeah, just clarifying here, so our numerator is community contributions and the denominator is GitLab team members. So it's not per external member.\n\nSo what we're doing there, Eric, is we're not trying to say how many MRs does someone send if they send something, we're saying how many MRs from external do we get for the size of our organization. Sorry, I have a childhood emergency outside the door. So maybe explaining the context behind this. The context is as we grow as a company, we should make sure we keep the community up, the logical thing is for the community to flatline and the size of the org to go and before you know it you've kind of outgrown the wider community. And what I'm seeing is we created this pre-sophisticated taxonomy with prefixes and postfixes to talk about these things but in reality, we've only got two of them and we keep forgetting we have a hard time discussing this thing. So I'd rather just name them simply, some two names for what they are rather than than using the taxonomy but also, I have the proposal of like what if we just tracked as a KPI of the percentage of total MRs that come from the community over time and we would see that drop. I love that. Let's do that instead. Ok.\n\nBut the thing, why we have this complex thing is because you can game that. You want to game that, you want to game that you just produce fewer MRs with the engineers at GitLab. So if you drive that really hard and say, this is your number one goal, it's very easy to achieve, you just tell all your engineers to produce half. We have different metrics to prevent that from happening the same way that like support SLAs and such kind of butters each other. I think we're comfortable to that but simplifying this would make these conversations go much if you as our CTO don't even understand them, we went overboard. So, I'm supportive, you understand them, and I forgot that I was reviewing this stuff this morning, I'm like there's a problem with this and then you just reminded me the context. So yeah, If I can't hold up my percentage that comes from the community, I love that. It's what all our investors ask about. Let's do that. Okay, cool. So Lily, if you can work with Max to make that transition, that would be great and I'll bold the one that we're talking about at the end of this meeting. Thanks, I'm off the call, sorry, I was a bit late. Timely. We do have Pis on the raw number of community MRs and we can make the shift and why they're confirming from the definition. I think this is the case. Cool.\n\nAlright, so Number Six Christopher, sorry, I was looking up to see if I had the percentage graph because I think we played around with this at one point and had a draft of that probably about five months back, if I can remember, Lily. I just wanted to, FYI, the month of February, if you were looking at any particular metrics, particularly in development, at MR8, we haven't had updates in four days. There's apparently a lag issue that's been problematic for the data team to basically get updated messages and updated metrics, and they're working on that. Okay. I'm sorry Mike, you got the next one. So yeah, there's some color there on the mitigation. The lag later on too severe, we continue the said FYI in addition to the KPI status. I'm sorry I wanted to just touch on the Postgres replication issue there real quick. I've, I've been trying to get my arms wrapped around it. Do we have the right attention to this? This is kind of, Eric, I don't know if you were commenting hi thing towards this in the last meeting around some of the infrastructure improvements on the product side. I'm just not quite sure whose responsibility is to focus on getting a handle of some of the constraints we have in replication.\n\nYeah, the, what I was mentioning in the product key review about an hour ago, I think is sort of like unrelated. And so, I think the driver needs to be your kind of data engineering team, but of course, there's a dependency on infrastructure because that's where the data is being piped from. They are, they do own that data source. Yeah. I'll say for the replication lag on that slave host where, I'm sorry, not the other, the secondary host where the data is being pulled from like the infrastructure would be the driver for that. And so any escalations that, well, I'll own those and I know we have an action plan for that as far as creating another dedicated host just for the data team to pull from. Okay. I did actually. I saw that issue and I did talk to Craig tomes a little bit as well on the database side just to see if there's some database improvements and I'm still trying to figure out, you know if it's truly just a dedicated computational sort of resource or a server or if there's actually some database tuning that needs to occur. Do you have a sense of that?\n\nYeah. If there is a dip in the age or the count overall, I think it's the latter. We need to dig in a bit deeper on that and also the data lag. I would like to reevaluate once we have the whole picture when everything is synched in as well. Christie, you have some insights? Yeah, I'm just wondering if part of this could be the fact that we changed the severity across the board for MRs to s2. So, we may have some older bugs in there that hadn't been addressed because they were at a lower severity. Now we've moved them to s2, and maybe that caused a little spike that could be the case. If we did it in a limited fashion, it won't be a huge volume. We also iterated after that to priority since Productville is prioritization, so I wouldn't account it entirely to that. I mean, this isn't the time for a key review but, I know that they've gotten backed up on those issues. So, if a good portion of those are in for created or related, then that might be lifting it as well. I can take the deeper digging and provide an update next time. I think we need extra debug slicing the data here. So, you would like to go to 0.8. Yeah, we're now measuring S1S2 Slo achievement with closed bugs but if you, you look at the number of bugs that as exponential growth and it would be trivial to us to achieve 100 Slo achievement. If you just look at closed bugs even though there would be a major problem in the company. 99% of all bugs are overdue as long as I only close ones that are still within the Slo.\n\nI will have great achievement. So I think it should be looking at the open box, the entire population or percentage of those within the Slo time. I think we're doing it the wrong way. Thanks for the feedback. Said hence why we wanted to have the average age to measure what's outside in the open. We can make this iteration to also focus on the age of all opened including open bugs. This is all something we have discussed with Christopher in the next iteration as well, and we're happy more than happy to adjust. So, the key, yes, go ahead. So, the average age would get closer to it, it's not what I'm proposing. What I'm proposing is the open box or percentages outside of Slo. So display it as a percentage you now just do about the open box, not the closed one. Got it. Okay, the exceeding Slo for open box. Yeah, or open bugs that are within Slo. So you have a chart that should go up and to the right like everything else sounds great. We can take it to the next data metrics workstream to deliver this. Cool. Thanks these are pretty... much a little tricky Mac. You'll have to figure out how to because we'd like to be able to have charts that we can historically reconstruct if we need to. So when tickets close out you need to go through their history to figure out at this time when it was open, did it breach the Slo or not. That's a good point. This might be much harder computationally and so I totally respect if we can't do it for that reason. Cool, I need Craig. Yeah, I just wanted to ask the team like, we went through all the key meeting metrics, everything looked in line with prior periods and looks good. Is there anything the team wants to call out especially that we should be watching? Yeah, I'll call out sow. The good news is in q4 we had our smallest decline over several quarters. So we only went down by a tenth of a point. The quarter previous was six tenths of a point, and the quarter before that was a full point. So, we see this as an improvement even though it was still a decline. But it's still a decline obviously. We want this actually tracking in an upward direction. We also don't have enough data to know whether or not this is an actual real trend. I'm optimistic. I think actually this is a good thing. We have had a much keener focus on SLAs over the past several quarters. So that's why I think okay. The work that we've done I think actually is catching up and getting noticed in SLAs.\n\nBut we got to keep an eye on it. We can't just, we cannot assume that, that's the case. Yeah, and the bug discussion above you kind of pointers up that we have an underlying problem right now in our metrics of measurement. So, if we change the measurements to reflect that the, hopefully we're in good shape. If we don't and we flatline and address it so that we flatline, open S1S and S2s, you will see a temporary jump in and us above SLAs and as we clear out that backlog over that period of time. I have point C which is similar to infrastructure. We need to get more security work prioritized. We're hearing that from the team. But, either that problem or that activity is sort of currently reflected in our security metrics. So we have some work to do. Long-term to make sure that we see things like that in the metrics and the measurements that we're making. Back to you, Sid. Oh, the arrow rate seems significantly below target and maybe, I hope that it would bounce back from December. I think it bounces back but not back on target. Any context there? What's going on? So, with family and friends days, we actually had some heavier vacation days in January than what we historically have. One thing to note is that we are actually at a higher MR rate if you go back the last 18 months. We're actually at a higher year MR rate than we were back in each month this year. So, if you compare October to October, November to November and January, I'm sorry. October, November, December, and January comparatively to last year, what you'll find is we're between a half point and a one-and-a-half MR rate above where we were in the previous year. That's great context. Thank you, Christopher. Good work. The expectation is February, a short month. We were at, I think, 16 workdays with friends and family day and other things. So obviously us having power outages in Texas does not help things either for the folks who are working in Texas. But hopefully the rest of the team is being effective. I was hoping to see a better result right now. But with four or five days particularly around release week, that's where we do see a little bit of higher activity. So, that's not accounted for yet. But, you know, March is where I'm expecting to kind of see a real rebound, much like we did last year. Awesome. Thanks, the other context I'll give is we now do time series targets. So when we change the target, you'll see that reflected in the line. So if we were to look back historically here, the goal here was actually lower and Christopher was ambitious, and we kept raising and we kept meeting that so it should stair-step here and we could go back and reconstruct that if we really wanted to. And the right original the seasonal dip here, we raised it to I think 11 and then we realized we're kind of hitting that point of diminishing returns and the right thing to do business wise and this is in our FY 22 direction is hold the line at productivity but start to raise other things related to quality, security, availability, and whatnot. So that kind of why you're seeing this bump is we raised it and we realized okay, that's not that we shouldn't raise anymore and we brought it back down to 10. So 10 will be the target going forward, I'm going to try to get better at many other things while preventing this from dipping. Cool and I just wanted to call out that it's not necessarily higher MR rates should also help to address security and quality and other things because you're more productive and so it's not necessarily opposite.\n\nBut I agree with let's hold the line 10 is a great number and focus on other indicators to improve. That makes a lot of sense. Well said. All right. That's it for the agenda. Anyone want to vocalize anything else? Great. Well, thanks, everybody, and I'm going to go check on my four-year-old and see if she got whatever she needed. So cheers and talk soon. Thanks."

        "captions": "Oh, attention, hey Albert! Hey, hey! Does it still take you a while to join meetings? Like do you have to join like two minutes early just to get Zoom going still? It's just like it's much faster, it's not immediate like five seconds or ten seconds, okay it's fine, cool. Mark, second, because he's in the document. Hey, Remy, hey everyone. I say we go ahead and get started. I see Mark's in the doc, I'm sure he'll join here soon. In the spirit of Remy coming back, I thought it would be fun to talk about a memorable trip or vacation people have taken. Mine, I think I will remember this for quite some time, is in March when I went to Aruba with my wife. It was right as the pandemic was starting and we kind of were waffling about going. It was great; Aruba is like an island in the Caribbean, so beaches, sun, things that we don't get to experience around here. Super fun. But as we came back, that was when everything was shutting down in the US and that's pretty much our only memory of the trip - we came back and the pandemic was unfolding in the US. I was talking with my wife about that this weekend, how it kind of soured the trip, but it was fun when we were there, but it'll be memorable for a different reason. Remy, what about you? \n\nAs for me, I love road trips, and I did some road trips with one of my best friends a few years ago. We went to Canada in the Quebec part and we did, I don't know how many, but like four or five national parks. So hiking obviously, and also we went to see whales in the Saguenay River, basically just like between the river and the sea. So yeah, that's a really cool memory, and the next year we did another road trip with the same friend in Scotland, and that was also super fun. Road trips are always fun like this year as well, in Italy, that was awesome. But yeah, I did many road trips. \n\nHow about you, Mark? \n\nMy most memorable would be India, so I spent two weeks in India. I think it was maybe about seven years ago now, but that was one of the first trips that I'd taken outside of Europe, and it was just amazing. It was just so different and experiencing that for the first time. But we traveled to maybe, I think, about six or seven different towns, traveling on the trains there because the trains in India are really cool. They've got different classes so you can sleep on there for the overnight trains or some of the short ones, there's not any beds. But we were on all sorts of different trains, and the trains themselves are a really cool experience. But we traveled down most of the west coast, and then back up again. It was only two weeks, but it felt really long, and we saw a lot of what they had in the south, including the backwaters, which is like lots of palm trees and lots of open water just set back from the coast. It's really beautiful. But that was especially memorable for me. \n\nAlbert, next, yeah. So like four years ago, my wife and I went to Japan, so that was very memorable because we went there for the Tokyo Marathon, and the Tokyo Marathon is known to be very difficult to get. People need to apply and there will be a ballot to tell you whether you get an entry into the race or not. And we both tried on the first attempt and we got it. It was quite memorable. It was fun; there are friends who have tried three or four times and they couldn't get an entry at all. So yeah, it was fun, and also because there's a lot of training leading up to it so it makes the trip more worthwhile, I would say. Yeah, so we went there followed by like one and a half weeks of vacation after that, just going up to different parts of Japan. The travel is really good there, very accessible; we could get from one city to another in one or two hours, so saves a lot of time. \n\nHow about you, Albert? \n\nI didn't travel a lot and I think the most memorable, not sure if it's most memorable, but it's at least a significant one that for the first time I give that country something I enjoyed in it. I went for my first time in Guatemala to Austin, and that's quite different because that's my first time where I really traveled alone because previously I always just came with someone and people bring me there, I didn't do anything. So that's my first time I really handled my trip and probably also other trips because the last time to Greece, that was my first time to Europe, and it's much different, Mexico, I never thought about going to Mexico and things like that. Cool, thanks for sharing everyone. Albert, really cool to hear about the Tokyo Marathon, I had no idea that's really cool. So I'll move into the announcements, try to move pretty quick here. I did want to pass on my thanks for being really flexible last week. It was a kind of a strange week for me, being without power and Internet. I liked to the storm, it's called a doratio. It's a hurricane. It hit us, which is a very 2020 thing to happen, like, year 2020, I feel. Um, it's essentially a Category Two Hurricane that went across the whole state. So I was watching TV before the power went out here and they were like, well there's going to be some severe thunderstorms, and they're like, well it's really building and it might produce a tornado and the power went out, and it was just, I mean, the devastation in the article that I linked to, the damage is pretty, pretty bad. Um, it's about 80 kilometers wide, consistent with speeds above 120 kilometers an hour. So it's pretty wild, hopefully never have to experience anything like that again. \n\nUm, they are tornadoes common in like the middle of the state. I've heard of one happening, I've heard of smaller ones happening in like Colorado and the mountains break it up, so it doesn't last as long. Minnesota, there was one that happened in Minnesota up into Canada a few years ago. But nothing that was in Iowa is flat, so there's nothing that is going to break it up. Um, really, and the storm just kind of builds on the airflow of itself, like that's feeding into it, and since there's nothing blocking air in Iowa, it's just flat farmland. The news said a storm like this hasn't happened in like 70 years here. So it's like a generational storm. Hopefully once in a generational. But yeah, thank you, everyone, for being flexible and kind of catching up easy. \n\nNext item, planning a test efficiency challenge, if you didn't see it in Q3, it's tied to their OPRs, I believe, to speed up Get Lab's tests. Remy pointing this out called it interesting. I thought I'd share it here. If you have bandwidth and you're interested in participating, feel free to contribute. I think it would be a good thing to demonstrate; we'd like to show how we can support others that are trying to improve the pipeline productivity. Another item, in case you missed it, associated quality weekly stand-up PM prioritization is being discussed and changed. Like the criteria is being changed at the E-group offsite. If you haven't given that issue a read, please do. It's relating to changing from stages per user and smout are stages per user to monthly active usage and it's going to really kind of change the focus, the decision-making within Product. Another reminder, our pipeline on-call drives, as we're working through things and you're finding inefficiencies, please consider our Q3 OKR to improve this and maybe if there's something small or a boring solution feel free to fix it as you're doing your work. \n\nTwo more quick reminders, team meetings are recorded and uploaded to Google Drive. I have not been uploading to Unfiltered but plan to do that after today's recording gets uploaded. And the last item, I didn't really see this broadcasted anywhere, so this came up in a one-on-one earlier. JAMFis is supposed to start. I haven't seen communication that has started opt-in pilot this week and we'll run for a month just to see how it works with developers and our software. So I linked to where I saw it communicated the clearest but something just to be aware of and keep an eye on. OK, all right, into the agenda, I wanted to welcome back Remy. I thought your trip sounded cool, driving through the country with a Tesla sounded really fun. \n\nUm, so welcome back; we're all happy to have you here. And, see ya, yeah. That was fun. The slide is just amazing. Did you use the? I don't remember the mode but like the mode that makes essentially acceleration, like superfast? I think it's like turbo mode or something like that. It's got like, yeah, like the sport mode, yeah. And my friend has the performance model Model 3, so it goes from zero to 100 kilometers in something like three seconds, it's just amazing. It's, yeah, you have to leave it to believe it, that's pretty cool. It's also great that you could get through with an electric vehicle just road-tripping, that's, that's yeah, yeah; actually there's a lot of, like, superchargers along the way and it's the Tesla that tells you like when to stop and where to stop, it's optimizing everything so it's, it's really convenient, and it was pretty weird already gotcha. Cool, welcome back. Um, the next item, I had, I just wanted to point out, I feel that I've done a really poor job clarifying priorities, especially the last two-three weeks. And wanted to use this as an opportunity to kind of talk through how I see things and any discussion related to this. \n\nI kind of ranked our KRs as well as some other workstreams. So I have the wider community efficiency KR as the most important because it's a pass-through KR, so it's from Engineering to Quality to our team, so that should be the item that we give the most attention and is probably the most important to complete within our KRs. The next item is dog food, improving the test file finder, and reducing the cost per pipeline. That'll help us out with our cost per pipeline KPI but also just enable more efficiencies. Right below that is KPI health short-term corrective actions, so things that are boring solutions or master broken fixes that can help keep our KPIs in a positive state. The other after that all other team OKRs, long-term KPI health, long-term KPI health corrective actions that may not apply to any OKR. \n\nThe other thing I want to call attention to is the Epic Centralized Handbook Metrics. This is like gaining and growing more attention, it's not explicitly all of the scope is not explicitly tied to our KRs for Q3 but this might be something that ends up getting swapped in for some other items so just be aware of that effort if you haven't given that a read those are the things I would call out as explicit priorities. Of course, there's going to be reactive work that comes up as well and I leave it up to the team's discretion to make the best decision that they feel in the moment. But I wanted to see if there's any questions on this priority list or any confusion. \n\nOkay, what sorry did I cut someone off there? Oh I think that was me but, just you know it makes sense to me, I think the priority makes sense to me okay. The next item I just crossed out, um the short version is it broke, there's a community KPI task within our community contribution KR that I broke into a bunch of different tasks with the intent that multiple people can work on them to learn, size, sense. I kind of chatted with a number of people in one-on-ones and I'm just going to assign those out. If you have explicit interest in a particular metric let me know or just even speak up in the issue and I'll assign it to you. Even if it's already assigned to someone else and they haven't started, feel free to express interest and we can shuffle things around. Remy, over to you on insights. \n\nYeah, so it's related to the scoping the priority and severity labels and yeah so it's sorted out but initially changing, changed default for the insights, the default labels, privacy, and civility labels, but then I noted that that would be kind of a breaking change because users that do use the default charts would not see any data anymore if they don't change their labels. So, we decided not to change that for now and we can do that in a probably in a major version change if we wanted to. Does the default set of severity labels get created, like get created, I didn't think so but I'm just curious? Oh, there is a set of default labels but it doesn't include the severity priority labels, it was more of like insights would provide these charts as defaults and if you wanted to utilize them, you'd make use of those. But some people may have already used those, but yeah we do have a default set of labels but it's like bug feature stuff like that. \n\nYep, okay, I totally agree with the decision. By the way, I wasn't trying to back away from it, it's definitely a breaking change, it's not worth doing. We'll do it; I was just curious there. Yeah, and maybe you could even think about like more like kind of an intelligent way of choosing the labels like we could probably detect if the labels are scoped or not and use the one that exists so that it would work in both cases basically like you know. That is what it will be, backward compatible and as well as forward compatible basically. Okay, thank you for handling that in the merge request, that was great, this team always has great async collaboration, it's always good to see examples of that too. Anything else on that one Remy or anyone jumping over to you on section label inference so section labels were wrong on last Friday, I think and it always, it gave 500 arrows for several times and I retried the jobs for more than 10 times and eventually it went through. So I guess maybe it's I cut off. The underlying arrow was tied out the query timer so I guess it's just a notice that it should be all done and maybe it shouldn't be an issue in the future. I mean, maybe it should just be temporary for the timeout. \n\nAnd the next is for the first scope, priority and secretive labels that all the merchants requests are already maybe up for review maybe not maybe not ready yet, but and I'm thinking about making a new feature a new issue which explains what would be changed and what people should expect and what people should do. And I don't think there is much they should do besides using the new labels. I will use this issue to point people to feedback before making the actual change and I am thinking if Kyle suggests that we do it next week and sure I don't really mind doing it when, when to do it. I just, I just feel if there's nothing wrong we can do it earlier maybe and see what everyone thinks. My thinking is just kind of there's more with this change so the changes themselves are simple but we may feel that we have a higher likelihood of missing something and needing to react quickly to it and with us being on-call this week. Oh right, that was my thought for next week also doing it late in the week like if it's Thursday or Friday. Sometimes those days are like if it's on if we merge it on Friday things might fail over the weekend that was my thinking. I'm open to what really what the team thinks is best. I think it's fine and that gives a longer notice for people actually to be aware of the change. \n\nYeah, so um if you create the issue added to the Engineering weekly review I'd say like next Monday, Tuesday would be a good good date to target for this time. That's good, um very next leader, so yeah, this one is just um repeating it from last week, so I added a MR to the Test File Finder gem that the testing group created. So it's basically to add a new option that takes in a specified like a custom mapping in a YAML file. So the idea is that we can use that to sort of replace the tooling that we have. I have another work in progress MR to experiment with the new gem using the same mapping to detect the first test that we are finding, we are detecting right now. Yeah, so I'm just open to any feedback on either of this. I'm for a second MR, there's a lot of configuration that we need to do in the mapping and I'm not very sure how it's, well, what is the best way to verify like whether the mapping is correct or not. \n\nSo what I did was, create a small script to just to verify what is expected, so previously so what we had before we could do a unit test on it, but in this case because it's extracted to a separate executable. So the next thing I tried was basically to pass the... to test the executable, the result... executable, um yeah. So I'll open any ideas on how we can improve this or how we can test it in a better way, um, yeah. So one thing about the mapping is that we can also be more cautious, we can add more mapping and we can uncover more files and if any of the test files don't exist we will just ignore it. Yeah, yeah, I think we can take this async and have comments on the cameras. That's very cool and that's great stuff. I will definitely take care; okay, great job picking that up and getting something together so quickly. So looking forward to see how this evolves. There's no other items on the agenda, last call for anything anyone wants to freestyle and bring up. Okay, I appreciate the time, it's good seeing the full team everyone together, I hope everyone has a good rest of your day, catch you later, bye."

We are going to be covering four of the six engineering departments here - development, quality, security, UX support, and infrastructure. Development and Infrastructure have their own key reviews, so we'll try to direct comments to those meetings when appropriate. I know we had the infrastructure key review this morning, and there's one that was directed to this meeting about development. Note, I believe Christopher has a conflict about halfway through and has to leave early, so if we could put questions for Christopher's development team up as high as possible in the agenda, we get to those first. So maybe Christopher, do you want to elevate number six in the agenda up to number four? Sure thing.\n\nHere's a few items we need to discuss:\n- The largest contented pair marked as a KPI should be at the 75th percentile.\n- We are adding a Grafa A to the handbook under performance indicators. It should point to a page with five charts showing our progress.\n- We plan to pipe it into the data lake and get it to the 75th percentile.\n- We are moving towards centralized handbook-first engineering indicators.\n\nThis completes the overall view of development, quality, and UX. Craig, this is where you'll be passionate about the bugs because now you see the drill-down bugs all the way through. We're also factoring in security and infrastructure going forward.\n\nIt's amazing progress, I think we made you our data czar two or three weeks ago, and this is a huge increase in a huge volume of work that was delivered. The gearing ratio for our stats is at 38 out of our target of 42, and this makes our software robust for enterprise customers. We should look at creatively fixing this gearing ratio issue.\n\nIn the infrastructure meeting, it was discussed that gitlab.com site performance needs attention. Development on the front end, in particular, is working on it, mainly because the signals are coming from usability surveys showing Front End issues. We need to clarify the different performance initiatives and make them clearer.\n\nRegarding the bug metrics, we are moving to provide drill-downs before making adjustments. We aim to keep the metric at the target for average days to close severe bugs.\n\nThe customer contribution by the wider community is increasing, and we need to circle back and see why it's happening and if the Ops section has more activity around this.\n\nWe are working on the MRR metric but being cautious as it's a sensitive metric. The conversation about creating it publicly could have implications.\n\nIn the product key meeting, there were discussions around trust and safety metrics and how mature our processes are when tagging users. This is a critical topic, and we have tools running to identify abusive accounts. We can provide metrics from these tools and automate the process.\n\nThe docs definitely need some design improvements, and we are working on addressing this. Thank you, everyone, for a great discussion. Talk to you all soon!"
