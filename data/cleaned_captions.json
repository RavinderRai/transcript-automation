    "rOqgRiNMVqg": "So, this is the security, governance, growth, and data science meeting applied to ML, ML Ops, and the anti-abuse team meeting. That's a mouthful. We might need a better name over time. And, that's our meeting for September 14th or 15th in APAC. Hi Ala, glad you're here. Why are you here when it's midnight? We can talk, glad you're here. Don't feel obligated to come to this meeting because it's late for you, and maybe so. But I'm glad. Thanks for coming at least once. News and events. I have a lot of things on the agenda today because of some of this. So, apologies for that, but I think it's going to go down over time based on feedback. I'll work. I'm going to work on doing more summarized communications to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group.\nThis was worked on for this group, adding more items to our staff meeting agenda more frequently, every only rather than posting on your Slack channel. I am going to assume that people, leaders on the team, will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the slack channel. So keep that in mind. Let's see B is a read-only item unless anybody wants to discuss it. And see Phil has his welcome Elle to the meeting. I've asked Ala to step in as acting full-stack manager for security policies while I hire a new one. Ala has graciously accepted. This wonderful opportunity. So welcome, Elle. Thank you. I've got the next item as well. The Anti-Abuse team is moving product sections from security to data science. Data science is effectively a rename of the Model Ops section. So data science will include two stages, the existing model Ops which has three groups in it, and the Anti-Abuse stage, which currently has only one group called Anti-Abuse. I think at some point, there are plans to split Anti-Abuse into two groups, but that's not in the near future, and we're working through all the changes around that. There's lots of Workday changes, lots of handbook changes. Mom, did you want to say anything more about data science or model Ops? Oh, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, so everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups, Model Ops, and the later data ops as part of it.\nYeah. So, thanks, Thomas, for continuing to compile and report out on all of my teams that I'm responsible for, engineering allocations, error budgets, reliability, and security incidents. So really do appreciate that. Gotta give Neal a high-five too! He does half of these now! And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide cover. And apologies, Neil, I totally forgot you took half a day since Thomas has been doing it for so long. But appreciating you. I know you volunteered for it, and we discussed it, but I just forgot. Kind of a thankless role, honestly, and I volunteered because of the exposure I get from it. It's nice to be part of a different collective group of people. I was...\n(Note: Character limit reached, continued in next message)",
    "Tmd5eKVgySY": "Obviously, I couldn't own right so it's the SEC growth data science staff meeting which we just discussed a confidential topic and now we're going to discuss the non-confidential things. It looks like Nate, you have the first item. Yeah, just a bit of news about new hires, the compliance group has a senior front-end engineer joining on November 28th. So that's our one, coincidentally based out of New Zealand as well, so that's awesome and we have another, hopefully some good news next week as well. Around this, now let's keep us moving, yeah I got next; we noted this in slack last week but it's worth repeating here, so we've got a four-year work anniversary and a three-year work anniversary one for first Versatia, the to garage, so they put up with us for a long time. This is always worth celebrating so I'm glad they're here so we'll consider the meeting, Mr. Earth is an outside shadow is also a community contributor, yeah foreign yep, so just news and events since we're coming up on a U.S holiday week next week, SEC retrospective we're going to go ahead and schedule it for the week after so that'll be November 30th or December 1st depending upon the location. We'll go ahead and do the same thing we've been doing with two session so just want to give everybody a heads up that those were coming and going to be scheduled, good stuff. So, Best in Class bi also known as bicokrs for securing Governor being finalized for Q4 by product management with a ETF Distributing them by the end of this week, once they are please be sure to engage on them ASAP as we want to accomplish the ones slated 4Q4 in Q4 wherever feasible. If it would help we can consider changing team priorities of the teams working on the okrs and those not to help out, please also continue to give PM feedback and ask questions about the okrs and the associated epics and issues to make sure we understand the goals and ways to deliver them as iteratively and effectively as possible. It sounds a little bit scary we're getting who cares you know, a couple weeks into the quarter; but the thing from PM is the best in class so cares are likely going to be the work already in the backlog, a subset of the work already in the backlog that we're already working on or planning to; but we don't know, for sure until we see them and I'm on vacation for the next two weeks so you won't see me bringing; you know, sharing a load of these once they're announced which is why I'm bringing up here, any questions or comments about that? So, yeah so that the tldr here is we're talking with our product managers, what work have you got coming up for us in Q4 that you've already prioritized that relates to Best in Class. Yes great and then we need to choose between those and other things we should choose those it's you know it's very very generic you know guidance of course, but we don't know the details yet so it has  [...]",
    "JwBNYjaEwmQ": "McDonald's Way, how you doing sir? I should announce this is the SEC growth since data science staff meeting for January 18th. I don't know, yeah. Hey George, hey Wayne, Hey Thomas. George, how are you, sir? I am good, how about you doing? All right, and I am admiring the reimagined series of elements on the wall behind you. I've heard this comment so many times, I'm sorry. It's fine, completely fine, it's not that actually. Yeah, but anyway, it's a design practice I used to try a while ago so we'll get started in about a minute. We're all early, that means everybody else is late, I say in gest since this is being live streamed, is it possible philosophically, is it possible to be late in all meetings or options? Is it possible, sounds like a quote from somewhere, I don't know. I think yes, if anyone who joins late asks people to back up in the agenda, you're actually late and you shouldn't ask for that. But all meetings are up. Hey, hey, how you doing, Wayne? Good, we'll get started in about 30 seconds. Did you have a good long weekend? Yeah, how about everybody else, George, Thomas, how was your weekend relaxing, largely good. I just need kids to not get sick anymore. So, it's the SEC growth data science staff meeting for January 18th. We were talking about other things before we get started but when we get started. So first, welcome, George, who's my shadow this week and a GitLab core community contributor, hey everyone. So, why don't we jump over to the tomorrow, it looks like you're the next item? Yeah. I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Lucas and James for receiving the discretionary bonus on their efforts on a recent customer escalation. Not only Lucas and James were involved, Thiago, thank you for not only proposing the discretionary bonus but also all your efforts on this as well as Neil, who is not present. So it's great collaboration across the stage section and other teams as well. In case you missed it, personal access tokens will now be automatically revoked for all GitLab core team members. It's a huge step in that continued trajectory of making this enabled for all customers. That's going to be happening for GitLab.com on January 23rd, and as well as self-managed on the 22nd of February. Dates still accurate as of now, but yeah, just a huge shout out to everyone involved in that effort as well, thanks, Simon. So we've got a development newsletter that we're working on to talk about in this meeting. Before and after reviewing it in Christopher's staff meeting, got some good feedback on it from a number of folks. So the details are here as we get started. In this epic, the first iteration is planned for February. If you have topics that you think should be included or you want to weigh in the topics that are included, please collaborate on the issue for the February newsletter and also please make your teams aware so they can collaborate on the content if they're interested in doing so. Some have already collaborated on it, which is great. I think I just posted this less than 24 hours ago, so good stuff. Please also review draft Q10 OKRs for Secure, Gather, Governance, Growth, and Data Science. I put mine earlier today and you know, please start working on yours, keeping these in mind but also coming up with your own based on the overall themes in the GitLab values. Of course, do we want to review these live, with that we've done that in the past, do we want to do that maybe in a Zoom emoji up down or if you want to or up if you want to, reveal a lot. I'm not going to share my screen because this issue is public, put in the chat and George, I think I said this to you as well. See you have it? Okay, good. So some of the themes and I've started mine based off of Christopher's ETC, but again, these are all drafts. So objective one. Increasing Revenue by growing a customer results mindset and delivering results. So continued, I'm going to summarize here, continued work on federal, on the how for vulnerabilities, meeting SLAs, for vulnerabilities, who for data science or AI assisted code suggestions, MVC and model registry MVC and the rest of these into this one are based off the product management. OKRs under secure continuous vulnerability scanning capabilities and dependency scanning and also a suit for secure a vision, proof of concept for real-time SAS, scan with the new web UI. These are I think a little bit more in flux. They're all in flux. I don't think product is settled on layers just yet but that's great. We've got to really look at them, questions or comments about those as I realized my issue has two objective threes so I will fix that as I talk. Do you want feedback or commentary on this issue or do you want it on the agenda or do you want it in Slack, where do you want it how about now? OK, whatever you prefer. I'll start now and I'll happily go. I'll write them where I'll write them in the issue. Dub has well continuous vulnerability scanning is competing against deprecating License Finder and so in composition analysis, so I'm dubious that both can be achieved, particularly during this particular quarter, particularly with 160 approaching at the very end. So, and I think License Finder replacement has the priority and the real-time SAS one target being web IDE or the web IDE replacements. Product is saying that won't be ready, web IDE replacement won't be ready for SAS until Q2 at the earliest. And so there, I know, I hear the they're not settled on that one yet, like you were saying earlier. But I'll put both of them in there, just because I've been saying, in the source issue that PM's goals and tags probably, you know, some of this but not uh so that's good to know.\n\nGood feedback, great feedback! Objective two, mature the platform to continue to be the leading DevSecOps platform. Continue TBD iterations to close Best in Class gaps pending discussion of product, 100% of our teams are using GitLab as an OKR tool, you know, we're getting off Ally, it's kind of an easy one for us to achieve but important to achieve, and raising the MRI rate TBD it's an overall Development Goal we want to look at ours as well. Objective three, career growth of team members, team member training or 360 feedback cycle figuring that out a hiring goal TBD to be determined, ton assessment follow-up and action plans based on feedback and finishing the world Finnish. Complete TYPO again complete the Gap Analysis and delivery of to be determined short-term wins for secure governance of growth in data science and lastly under application health, error budgets, and continue to burn down the list of customer impacting S1 and S2 bugs. Generally, we made progress, we're always making progress on these including in Q4. \n\nThat's initial patter on these. Wayne is objective to KR1 does it overlap with objective three KR4 so the gap analysis and the, and the big gap, yeah, good point, very good point we need to simplify that, where do you think it fits better? oh it doesn't fit that well in Korea, I mean we're already doing the efforts of big right, so between the two I would keep objective two KR1, yeah I'm going to delete that, it's a duplicate in the wrong place anyway, good catch. Before you do because I was looking at the I was looking at Christopher's OKRs yesterday, I saw the after this key, I saw I had the same question Saga did but I had separated them eventually in that, I think some teams haven't finished the gap analysis and I think this is to be a follow-on to the work that's happening in this quarter, whether as 2.2.1 is what iterations have been identified that are not the quick wins. I think they're separate though it's fine, fine margins. I'm still going to move it that's a good point I'm going to move it to the above one, because it was definitely the wrong objective, just refresh see if that looks makes more sense, basically I moved up simplified it and and moved it up from objective three objective two Wayne, for application Health, the resolve S1 and S2 are we just looking to achieve a particular velocity on a regular basis because we'll always have bugs coming in right, so it's not necessarily a burn-down but maybe just a cap as to where we want to be or a threshold and maybe maybe also with a focus on overdue ones. I don't know if we have any current overdue ones but Omar you weren't tracking the equivalent okr for Q4, was that about overdue ones or any, uh... last I checked, there weren't any err due once. Seth mentioned, if they did pop up under S2 but they were worked through and closed down as a result and we don't want to get to zero right, because as Seth, you mentioned, they're always coming in, we want to get to zero right, but we don't want to have that as a goal. It would be resolving number of them which would perhaps be the number we have currently and some more, assuming more coming but yeah, we'll figure that out, that makes sense, yep great question. Additionally, I think a focus on S3 and S4 might also be a good one because the list of us during the sport seemed to be longer, usually always a longer than this one. It is too okay, I know we're discussing this async which is great please put the comments later or not if you don't have been the Google Doc which is just fine, you know Adam to the issue that'd be great. So we're collaborating there as well for folks who didn't make the meeting or read it later or we forget. All this great feedback, alright moving on to the next topic, someone volunteer to verbalize. C yeah sure, let\u2019s see from last staff meeting, looking for volunteers to contribute to the audit work efforts, this can be any EM or higher, ICS can also help with the technical bits. Sam and Darva have started on this but we could use some help, the context, these efforts justify our financial audit and as such are important to the overall success of the company more details in this document link here. Yeah, I just went through this I got some time to look at this I volunteered for one part, we're still looking for volunteers for others, so take a look see if you're interested for you or your engineers because there's some work for that fits nicely in a people leader and some for engineers as well some automation work. Is this a requirement just as a publicly traded company or is this just a standard business practice to have a financial audit every year that is a great question, I don't know, maybe I'm sorry kind of related is this the audit that like the auditor signs off on as part of that or because we also talked about audits for federamp and audits for this and audits for RubyGems and we use the term audit quite a bit looking at the Christopher staffing i...cg controls is what it's about what is i...cg I don't actually know what i...cg is, equals my friend that's pad my team, general controls great question maybe to ask um does a quick search looks like it's part of Sox which would be part of being a public company okay thanks for volunteering to um to read those, Thomas it looks like you've got next all right, this is just a big thank you from me so... particularly for everybody's participation those weekly error budget issues we've got a link to this week's available there from the agenda. It was my week to represent everyone here in the engineering allocation meetings that happened my yesterday and the content here was hugely helpful not only in the short cutting the amount of time it took to prepare for that conversation but it also providing additional context as to what was going on and so this was this was a big help. So thank you, thank you for this and it's much appreciated and extremely helpful you got to verbalize that I was going to yeah, nice mustache, I love that mustache mode I've been seeing it for years I miss it when I don't see it, you know Alexander from Machete's team is staying in my house with me and he early got this mug, I said people are going to ask you where's Thiago and what have you done to him so he got a different mug if he happens to use it and joins a meeting he has to join through your Zoom account. We'll let him know any questions for the group George based on what we discussed and also does the group have any questions for George. George has been a core team member, community contributor to GitLab for many years I introduced George Tim Zolman and they said oh hold on a second we've known each other for years since Tim's been around as well so George you move any questions for us or do we have any questions for George as a community contributor hello again George we saw each other tomorrow how are you enjoying the experience it's been great so far very informative and I mean I feel close to the yellow team and it feels good to be part of this process here, do you feel like all the core members would benefit from the experience absolutely, yeah, I brought this initiative to the core team meeting a while ago and apple will bring it up so maybe others may be interested in joining yeah it's great having you and all this coming in it's going to bring us closer to the community I like it so welcome let me think that George and I discussed earlier that we don't have a lot of community contributions to the secure governance growth and data science compared to the other stages and one of the reasons maybe that people like contributing to things that they use and most of our stuff not all of it most of it is you need an ultimate license to use and a community contributor can get an ultimate license to do community contribution work but they're not going naturally gravitate towards it unless they're already at a customer that has an ultimate license so I don't know if this would this surely would not be the only thing to increase community contributions first off the video of some including dev or full handle he's done a lot in the past I really appreciate him but for multiple reasons not just this one, let me move a subset of secure features and maybe governance features as well to the open core or the open-source part of the product and rather than being binary like you can't get any of it unless you are an ultimate customer where we couldn't move too much or people would have no reason to pay but maybe we move just enough where the open-source community gets access to those and value them and the I think directly they start using them and directly they may have feedback on them and they can go and improve it themselves with everybody and contribute so. I know we've talked about this as a concept in the past and just figured I would throw it in front of the group for their thoughts Wayne have we considered switching the responsibilities on the ultimate license so for example as soon as we notice a new core member contributing we reach out and say hey he's an ultimate license valid for whatever we're comfortable with and keep track of that and just use that to build a stronger link will that be taxing on us have we thought about it. I don't know if we thought about it but it sounds like a great idea yeah right George you received he say hey he's your ultimate I said what does this do let me go have a look I think it's already part of the heroes program where you know when you contribute after some time you also get the ultimate license for a group but I don't remember if it's like on the first tire or the second cool maybe this is combining the ideas Thomas you were saying yeah George when you're looking for or identifying where you're going to contribute how do you identify that opportunity is it by issues is it by things you notice is it features you want what do you think how do you look I have multiple ways I mean sometimes it's just something in the application that bothers me or it's like moving one pixel to the left or there is something that I'm always always looking for migration initiatives where we migrate to the pajamas components and make the application more robust and yeah sometimes I just go through the community contributions take a look what's going on if there's anything I can help forward things to the right person or team but yeah, like... open-source in some parts of the security features would be really nice because you know when you contribute to something it would be nice to get something out of it or use it later and I think in the past historically we have been open sourcing features from the premium tiers and that would be something to consider for them. \n\nThanks everybody, have a great day.",
    "Y33pKPUamCQ": "Directly, hey! The recording is cool, nice. So I know that you have had some discussions in the last session which I didn't attend due to my day off, about the capacity for the UX research and communicating that to the PM's. So, you're curious. So, will you guys move this topic to this session? What were some of the outcomes? Where did you finish, you know, what was discussed? Basically, there was a pretty long discussion, and I mean like multiple views, and there are different perspectives on how we should manage this. So, I don't think we reached a concrete conclusion besides, yes, we need to communicate our capacity to our PM's and we need to find a good way to do that. I don't think we reached a very concrete conclusion, and I think there were still thoughts regarding these. That's why we moved it here - can I conclude that conversation, any idea of where to start? \n\nI'm curious, how do you do this? How do you guys do this at the stages today, at your stage groups? I thought more about it, I definitely can, like, 'm more mindful about it this way with my PM's to see how I was communicating my capacity and I realized that maybe I don't have mechanisms to report that capacity to them. At least not like, until we meet and say like, we go through the backlog or the roadmap and there's, like, okay I can do this, I can do that. But, yeah. So I realized that maybe there's something missing, which is having better visibility of my situation, it's a little bit different\u2026\n\nMoving on... Up to 2 PM to group two, so like, I think it's very important for them like how things are, like how one team works on one of my projects, so they can plan against my work there. But still, I think there's an opportunity there to be more communicative, more you know? Like, I don't know if it's like maybe, you know, like sharing with them like aboard in slack with all my issues you know, maybe that could be something so they can just look in to that like synchronously. But that's my idea that I had\u2026\n\nOr maybe just like kinda like telling them, like at the beginning of the week, this is what I'm doing this week, I am at full capacity, expect me not to be available to work on these. I'd be more practical, that's what I thought. I like those, those were the thoughts that I have that I was having the discussion with \u2026 a few weeks ago. \n\nSo the idea is that you have your columns of problem validation, you got your design workflow, design validation, and workflow solution validation and instead of filtering down for a milestone, we filter down to, you know, you assignee, so you filter down to continuous integration, and the other me, Dimitri\u2026 within those columns and if one moves to the next, or one moves to planning breakdown or scheduling, whatever it means that a spot has opened up to some extent, it's a simplified way of looking at it because we don't individualize issues\u2026 \n\nAnd so on\u2026 The text is now clearer, more readable, and easier to follow. It provides a more cohesive and understandable narrative.",
    "kGHyK_SkZB0": "My car, maybe you can... yeah, but I don't know where this is getting recorded to a cloud or my computer anyway. Yeah, so I was saying that Sajug I learned a lot from the process that you were following and all the learnings that came from that and so, like, we thought that it's going to be good to kick it off as soon as possible and not wait for everything to develop first and then think about where to place it. Yeah, yeah, I think this is the right way to go. Thanks for sharing. My item, there is a pretty big and rather radical change from the cicd private catalog. So we discussed this a lot and this came up and inspired me a lot while I did the journey map exercise, and I didn't feel it's right to have this private cicd catalog scope her namespace because we have interviewed several self-management customers. It could be really multiple namespaces. I'm not going to disclose the exact number but it could be a lot, of course, it depends on the organization's side and how Dove announced this change and this will impact a bit of our product roadmap or the timeline. Design-wise, the impact is not that big, but I think this is the right way to go. So, I was really supportive about this change, and yeah, you can see how we simplify the structure. So, we will have one organization catalog and one open-source catalog that is kind of similar to The Marketplace. I have personal updates so you can read through it. I might need to reschedule some of our coffee chat or one-on-one if I need to from next week until the end of September. Wanted to share with you all. So, Hiya's item, emojis are not working. It's mostly common control shift that works for me to show the model for the Emojis. I use it a lot, so I'm not sure if it's a storage space issue. Okay, so Maria is not here, so we can just go through this asynchronously. Maybe we can move to research, yes. So, I am just analyzing all the sessions from how do we use AI to help users optimize their Runner and CI builds, and it was pretty cool. We used a decision tree process from this book on AI that I'm reading, and basically, the idea is if you can put the decisions into clear if-then statements, then you have support that you can automate this workflow a bit. So, we didn't know if it would be like I think about this, but that's related to this, and this is really - but actually, it's like pretty straightforward, anyway. So, I won't go into the results, but I'm working on the report. And that'll come out, I think I'll share it with the uxr team soon and then it will come out next week. But there's really good information in there about just the details that people need to make decisions and kind of the outcomes for optimizing Pipelines. And the process is very trial and error and set it and forget it. That's the main thing. So, I think that's like one of our CI learnings \u2013 Just like the biggest thing I've learned at gitlab is that they don't think of these things in their minds, either like they specialize in it, they execute, and then they go away. But I think that there's also findings related to how to support teamwork. So, I think you'll like the report and then next week or as soon as I kind of get my mind into that report, then I'll start working on how users are using gitlab and the cloud. Do you want to ask your question? Yeah, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the effort? Yeah, so I'm actually very proud of us as a product company that we're like ready to move into this space. So, we're looking at kind of the connection points between gitlab and the cloud and like where the workflow lengths are, kind of the tools that users are using. And that'll inform part of some integrations that we're building like soon with GCP. But then also long term, what works well in terms of integrating that, does it? And that's actually, well, where I think we can bring in some questions about like resources and whether or not they should live at the project or the group level, like how teams access like secrets, for example, like where do those get stored in gitlab and is it like higher up organization? Because I'm thinking a lot about this new change that's coming related to organizations with some new modes because that's like the new play with the catalog which I think is really smart, which is to put it up there. But then I'm wondering like what else could we move up there, like maybe the secrets because they're at the company level. But that's what we can look into, talking about that Erica, I like, can you later go and chime into the issue that I've created for navigation and like share your views there? Because yeah, we don't want even though I have mentioned about like taking it out of cicd, if there's any research that points that we should have it maybe as a part of my navigation or at a higher level in navigation, we should be aware of that and that would help us inform the methodologies that we would like to select for research. Okay, so I think we haven't gotten that detailed because that's actually like really tactical. Most of the research so far has been like, what is a secret? So, I'll look, I'll look, I'll put the lens on there. But I think I won't have much, but I think from this study we might get something. Okay, okay, and by the way, I've also picked this up based on your recommendations. You can read that chapter three. Oh, sorry, okay, go ahead. Oh, it's okay. I just had another follow-up question. Are you only looking at gitlab SAS users? So, trying to read through your issue, and I mentioned that because one of the teams that I work with in Enablements currently, the Application Performance Group is changing their name to Cloud Connector. Okay, and they're focusing on self-managed users, essentially giving them access to like AI features and things that would be available through gitlab SAS, but at the self-managed level. So, that might be a good team to connect with, you know, in terms of this research, okay, awesome. Well, thank you, thank you. I think we landed on the stats. Yeah, but either way, I think they would at least be interested in that. So, helpful, well thank you. I'm embarrassed that I can't quickly find that in the issue, but it's okay. I'm on this other project, so if you want to ping their entire group, I can list the channel there and then I can also list the PM as well. Okay, cool. I'll just put, thank you, thank you. We're a good team and then I have this note, I have to find it you know, but I'm watching The Sessions again and again so it's coming, but there's this lovely quote about how we made a change and the details people could see about the pipelines completing and this woman was like I love it. I used it the other day to show my Executives that I need more funding for my pipelines because I could show like kind of the times and how if we reorganize things this would impact the times. And then she used that to buy more of our product. So that's like the best, you can put this in your portfolio where are we showing the pipeline summary. I'm sorry, oh, so, well, I mean, I don't know, but what she was telling me was that the new way that she can look at the metrics allowed her to make this argument. I need to pull up, I'll pull up the quote. Okay, it was Priyanka, okay, the other updates before I go over, you know they protect me, so I don't necessarily have anything connected to delivery or dedicated this week, I guess just announce what I'm working on outside of that, doing some research for organizations that I think Erica talked about in the U.S we could call earlier in the week. So, I included the research issue and I've been constantly adding and refining research questions there and then I'm doing a workshop on breaking changes. So, I'm adding people from different departments at the moment and it could be doing that soon and it's going to be kind of a mix of async and synchronous workshop parts. I was looking for Jocelyn on the list because has been struggling with breaking changes and I see her there, yeah, that was somebody who came up pretty quickly in conversations with the PM that I'm working with, Sam. He was like Jocelyn definitely let's include her, but if you have any other suggestions on who might be a good person to include, let me know. That's all the updates that I have this week. Okay, so what does, we are at the end of the agenda. Anything that someone wants to bring up? If not, then this is it, it's in the meeting here. Bye everyone. Have a good one. [Music]",
    "HFEFQ4NcgSQ": "Yeah, so I'm just going to go over some of the things that the pipeline authoring team is doing to figure out a better way to collaborate between UX, PM, and Engineering. So first off, we had lots of discussions in the retro that I started to gather feedback from the engineers on how they would like this retro, yes, on how they would like to work with UX. So, like how do they want to collaborate on issues, when do they want to be included, what is the preferred way to receive updates from UX, like all of these things, and our front-end engineers provided lots of very detailed feedback that really helped me better understand what is the problem, what is the gap that exists between us, and it answered a lot of questions for me and kind of opened my eyes to some of the problems that I didn't think were problems. So, there was a discussion here with some follow-up questions and stuff based on that, and based on the survey that I ran to kind of set a benchmark score, which actually I have to finish analyzing. I kind of analyzed the results but haven't really documented them yet. So, I have to do that, but I ran a survey, it's anonymous, so I can share the results with you I think, which was interesting because it really highlighted that there's a gap between what the engineers want and what I'm providing, even though I felt like I'm really doing a great job communicating all of the UX findings, but I just wasn't doing it in a way that made a lot of sense to them and that was easy for them to consume. It turned out that a lot of the team members didn't really feel included or excluded into the process. I guess they just don't really feel that much involved. I'll kind of go over some of the most interesting results. But, most participants didn't understand how UX research ties into our product direction and the user experience, so that was interesting. Also, because for me and Dove, it's obvious, we know why we're doing it and we know why it's important and we share it, but it's just like we weren't able to really show how it ties to our product direction yet at least because again, we're very new, so I guess it's normal that we're going through this process. So, there's an opportunity for us to establish more trust, for example, to show like a more solid foundation that we already have in our heads but show it to the rest of the team of all the UX research insights and all the opportunity canvases that Dove has been working on, you know things like that. So, there's also where I propose some changes, but there will be many more changes mainly just like simplifying things. You can go over this if you're curious about what are the things that I'm hoping to accomplish in terms of UX collaboration on the team. And there's an ongoing discussion here between the engineers and the engineering managers and job. And if you have any comments, also feel free to share them. Chairman, if you have any suggestions for like what worked for you, so we're still in the middle of it today, we have a sync discussion like some of the team members are breaking up pretty early. I'm staying up late for this because it's super important. So our goal is to align on a small process change that we know will be impactful and that we will be piloting. And for now, we're thinking that we will focus on fostering async communication and async updates between engineers and UX to help us document everything better and that will like solve many problems in terms of the shared understanding that we create and how accessible the information is. So yeah, very excited about this and it's been taking up a lot of my time and just like kind of mental energy just because it's this kind of messy human relationship thing that needs to be...\n\nLet's see how that works out. Thank you for sharing this media, I know that we've been talking about this, it's a recurring theme across GitLab, and I'm curious to hear also from others. I know that, Vitica, with your team, you managed to align things in, I would say, much easier way, and your onboarding and you getting to know people, but yeah, I'm curious to hear with your experience and your thoughts on the survey and the results that media shared. And I couldn't put a finger on what is going right, but I'm very happy with how things are. The engineers are very responsive, and they're always keeping an eye out for any new updates on the issue by me or by someone else. So the discussion part of the CI team, it's very healthy, and it's very productive, that I'm just having a hard time of taking out an actionable improvement that the pipeline authoring team could make by getting inspired by how we work because it's also organic. So that last milestone 1311 was my first milestone fully as a designer in release. So for me, it was rather than having an optimal process just having any process was the first time I was implementing a design process here. I already got really good feedback on how I can improve and some things I realized were not ideal. So I'm going to start using loom videos, for example, to communicate the broader design division for an issue because just typing walls of text sometimes doesn't really work as well to communicate the meaning behind the design changes...\n\nAdia, I think it's really great how not only you had this initiative to improve the process but also you used the design process to improve the design process, that was really amazing, the survey and everything. I'm still figuring out where to go in terms of the design process for release, but I'll definitely steal some of your ideas to have better feedback in a similar way, more structured right rather than just asking hey, what can I improve? So, thanks for the really good example. Yeah, I think my main learning from this whole process so far was that I should have run the survey like one week into the pipeline authoring team being formed just maybe not this exact survey but to better understand the background of all of the engineers and how they're used to working to understand what gaps to expect and what gaps to kind of predict that they will form because like this is their background and this is my background so I could adjust earlier on. But yeah, better late than never. Yeah, that was actually going to be my point. I was cycling this...",
    "qGFoZ8yodc4": "Hi, this is Eric John. It's February 18, 2021. And this is the engineering key review at GitLab. So, I've got a number four in the agenda, which is a proposal to break up this meeting into four departments: engineering, development quality, security, and UX infrastructure and support do their own key reviews. Already I have the reasons why; increase visibility, able to go deeper, increase the objectivity with which my reports can manage their groups, allow me more time to focus on new markets, and allow me to shift into more of a question-asker mode than generating content and answering questions in these meetings. But to avoid adding three more meetings to stakeholders' calendars, I propose we do a sort of two-month rotation, so month one development quality, month two security, and UX would go. How do people feel about that proposal? I think in the group conversations, it's working really well. So, I'm supportive, and this is the smallest thing. Maybe we need four meetings a month since it's the biggest department; it's super essential. But, you propose this; I don't. I could see either way. So let's stick with the proposal. Cool, we'll try it, and we can be flexible. I mean, the development is larger; maybe they go more frequently or something like that, but we'll see how it goes. Alright. And then I've got number five, which is we've got R&D overall MR rate and we also have R&D wider MR rate, both as top-level KPIs for engineering. The difference between them is the simplest sense is that R&D wider MR rate includes both community contributions and community MRs. The problems I see with this are that one, the wider MR rate the one that includes internal and external MRs, it duplicates the overall MRA which is sorry; the wider MR rate should just be external, and the overall should be narrow plus wider. Ay sorry so there's I'll have to check the taxonomy, Lily can you confirm? Sorry that's Sid's reasoning is my understanding as well. Yeah, I believe wider MR rate just captures community contributions only, and no internal, yeah. And the reason we measure that is that one of the most likely failure modes is that we lose the community, yeah. So, Eric, where it gets goofy is this that when you look at a specific team within the company, there could be contributions outside of that that aren't community contributions, they would be viewed community contributions by that group but effectively, they're not from outside the company. So that's why we use wider to kind of reflect that and narrow is very specific to the team. Are you saying that if someone in plan contributes to verify it's viewed as wider, not quite that? Plan and verify are just fine, it's when you look at like the development versus infrastructure, infrastructure will oftentimes contribute to developments work, but it won't be counted as MRs. Okay, that's a potential bit of funkiness that we should talk about separately. I did not have that in my sort of critique of this, but that doesn't necessarily make intuitive sense to me. So, part of my critique of this can be thrown out because it's not as duplicative as I thought. But I still think there's a problem with R&D wider MR, which is this thing doesn't really move in part because it's a rate. So it feels like the way to drive this up is to specifically drive community authors to contribute more than one MR per month. That's how this moves up because it's a productivity rate like we use internally. And that doesn't necessarily feel like the right thing because there's scenarios in which this goes up, we've actually got fewer contributions overall and fewer contributors overall. Wait, wait, wait a second. So you're saying that R&D wider MR rate is the number MRs per external contributor. Oh my goodness, that should not be the thing. It should be contributions per GitLab team member. So the country, below is the external audience. The thing above the division is the external ones, the thing below is the number of team members at GitLab. Is that the case, Lily? I'm checking right now. I think so. International team members unless we start calling people outside the company team members, it shouldn't be done, yeah. Just clarifying, here. So our numerator is community contributions and the denominator is GitLab team members. So it's not per external member. So what we're doing there, Eric is, we're not trying to say how many MRs does someone send if they send something. We're saying how many MRs from external do we get for the size of our organization. Sorry, I have a childhood emergency outside the door. So the maybe explaining the context behind this. The context is as we grow as a company, we should make sure we keep the community up. Like the logical thing is for the community to flatline and the size of the organization going before, you know it you've kind of outgrown the wider community, yeah. And what I'm seeing is we created this overcomplicated taxonomy with prefixes and postfixes to talk about these things but in reality, we've only got two of them and we keep forgetting we have a hard time discussing this thing. So I'd rather just name them simply, some two names for what they are rather than using the taxonomy. But also like in F, I have the proposal of what if we just tracked as a KPI of the percentage of total MRs that come from the community over time and we would see that drop. I love that, I love that let's do that instead. Okay, but the thing why we have this complex thing is that you can game that you want to game that you just produce fewer MRs with the engineers at GitLab. So if you drive that really hard and say this is your number one goal, it's very easy to achieve, you just tell all your engineers to produce half. So we have different metrics to prevent that from happening, the same way that like support SLOs and SAC kind of buttress one another. I think we're robust to that. But simplifying this would make these conversations go much easier, if our CTO doesn't even understand them, we went overboard. So I'm supportive, you understand them, and I forgot, and I was reviewing this stuff this morning, I'm like there's a problem with this, and then you just reminded me of the context. So yeah, if I can't hold up my head as a percentage that comes from the community, I love that; it's what all our investors ask about. Let's do that, okay cool. So Lily, if you can work with Max to make that transition, that would be great, and I'll bow to the one that we're talking about at room number 3. Thanks, I'm off the call, sorry I was a bit late. Timeliness, we do have the PIs on the raw number of community MRs and we can make the shift and why they're confirming from the definition. I think that only counts for community and then that's what the definition is, cool. Alright, so number six, Christopher? Sorry, I was looking up to see if I had the percentage graph because I think we played around with this at one point and had a draft of that probably about five months back, if I can remember, Lily. Just a FYI, the month of February, if you were looking at any particular metrics, particularly in development at MRs, we haven't had updates in four days, there's apparently a lag issue that's been problematic for the data team to get updated messaged out at metrics, and they're working on that. Okay, I'm sorry, Mike, you're next up. Alright, so yeah, there's some color there on the mitigation, the lag, delay in serve. We continue, I said FYI, an addition to the KPI status, I'm sorry, I wanted to just touch on the PostgreSQL replication issue, they are real quick. I've been trying to get my arms wrapped around it, do we have the right attention to this? This is kind of, Eric, I don't know if you were commenting to this in the last meeting about some of the infrastructure improvements on the product side. I'm just not quite sure whose responsibility is to focus on getting a handle on some of the constraints we have in replication. What I was mentioning in the product key review about an hour ago, I think it's sort of unrelated and so I think the drive needs to be your kind of data engineering team, but of course, there's a dependency on infrastructure because that's where the data is being piped from. They do own that data source. Yeah, for the replication lag on that slave host, where sorry not the secondary host where the data is being pulled from, like the infrastructure would be the driver for that. And any escalations, but I'll own those and I know we have an action plan for that in terms of creating another dedicated host just for the data team to pull from. Okay, I did actually, I saw that issue and I did talk to Craig Gomez a little bit as well on the database side just to see if there's some database improvements and I'm still trying to figure out if it's truly just a dedicated computational sort of resource, a server, or if there's actually some database tuning that needs to occur. Do you have a sense of that? So I'd say it's three different things. It's having a dedicated host that doesn't have conflicting query traffic coming from other workloads. There are some tuning performance or tuning improvements to be made and their, there's also improvements in this is where it does relate a little bit to what the topic was in the last review, basically the overall demand of the database layer from the com activities and improving those. So it's definitely not just one of those things, but one of the most specific actions we're gonna take though is separating out and having a dedicated house so that we're just dealing with the profile of the data engineering traffic on there and not having conflicting queries affecting the ability to update the replication, Steve. I definitely want to partner with you on this, because I don't know, if the demand on those databases is only going to increase, it's not going down, and I think we need to get I'm still unclear on where to focus in to get the biggest bang for the buck. I think if the computational resource dedication, that's going to be a good thing, but it's probably going to squeeze the balloon and the next area will unearth itself. Okay, and I'll tell you what, I'll put the, to the infrastructure review for next week. Okay, an update on this. Thank you, Steve. Uh, back to Maco on Sitecore? Great, thank you, a d Rob was in the assassination incident this morning as well, Ryan just said we have the attention there, number seven, just to provide an update on previous conversations, we're continuing to improve defect tracking against SLOs. There is a first iteration PI that we were experimenting to show a percentage of defects meeting the SLOs key findings as are hovering at 80%, S2 at 60%. We've been focused mostly on S1s and S2s at this point, and is hence, why S3 and S4 are lower. And this will likely be the case, and we are also in point B and are working on the measurement for average open box age. This would give us a whole picture of what's left. If the age goes up or down we should be clearing the backlog the average age should go down as well. There's no PI yet but I just wanted to update and ensure that we're on this. It's not off track. Number C, on S2, Craig? I just was looking through the charts and I noticed that there was a spike in meantime to close. Yeah, and just wanted to see if you had any insight into that for us. This is the S2s, this is one looked fine. This is where the point, beyond age supplemental shards in the backend helps. So I haven't seen a dip in age or the count overall. I think it's the latter, we need to dig in a bit deeper in that and also the data lag. I would like to re-evaluate once we have the full picture when everything is synced in as well. Christie, do you have some insights? Yeah, I'm just wondering if part of this could be the fact that we changed the severity across the board for MRs to S2 and so we may have some older bugs in there that hadn't been addressed because they were at a lower severity. Now we've moved them to S2 and maybe that caused a little spike. Yeah, that could be the case. If we did it in a limited fashion, it won't be a huge volume. We also iterated after that to P9 priority since product now is prioritizing. So I wouldn't account it entirely to that. I mean, this is not the I for a key review, but I know that they've gotten backed up on those issues. So if some portion of those are in for created or related, then that might be lifting it as well. I can take the deeper digging and provide an update next time. Thank you, Craig. So, the back to mecco on site core. Yeah, thank you, a d Rob was mentioning the assassination incident this morning as well, Ryan just said its getting the attention there. Number seven, just to provide an update on previous conversations, we're continuing to improve defect tracking against SLOs. There's a first iteration PI that we're experimenting to show a percentage of defects meeting the SLOs, key findings as are hovering at 80%, S2 at 60%, we've been focused mostly on S1s and S2s at this point, at hence the way S3 and S4 are lower. And this will likely be the case, and we are also in point B, and are working on the measure for average open box age. This would give us a whole picture of what's left. If the age goes up or down we should be clearing the backlog the average age should go down as well. There's no PI yet but I just wanted to update and ensure that we're on this. It's not off track. Craig on S2, yeah, I was looking through the charts and I noticed that there was a spike in meantime to close. Yeah, and I just wanted to see if you had any insight into that for us. This is the S2 is the S1 looked fine. This is where the point beyond age supplemental shards in the back end helps. So I haven't seen it dip in age or the count overall. I think it's the latter, we need to dig in a bit deeper in that and also the data lag. I would like to re-evaluate once we have the full picture when everything is synced in as well. Christie you have some insights? Yeah, I'm just wondering if part of this could be the fact that we changed the severity across the board for MRs to S2 and we may have some older bugs in there that hadn't been addressed. Because they were at a lower severity now we've moved them to S2, maybe that caused a little spike. Yeah Jack Jack? That could be the case. If we did it in a limited fashion It won't be a huge volume. Also iterated after that to P9 priority, since product now is prioritizing. So, I wouldn't account it entirely to that. I mean, this isn't the key review, I know that they've got backed up on those issues. So if some portion of those are in four created or related, then that might be lifting it as well. I can take the deeper digging and provide an update next time. Yeah Jack, I want to call the team I went through all the key meeting metrics and everything looked in line with prior periods and looked good. Is there anything the team wants to call out, especially that we should be watching out for? Yeah, I'll call out so the good news is in Q4, we had our smallest decline over several quarters. So we went down by a tenth of a point. The quarter previous was six or six-tenths of a point, and the quarter before that was a full point. So we see this as an improvement. Even though it was still a decline, but it's still a decline. Obviously, we want this actually tracking in an upward direction, we also don't have enough data to know whether or not this is our actual real trend, so I'm optimistic. I think this is a good thing. We have had a much keener focus on SLOs over the past several quarters. So that's why I think okay the work that we've done, I think is actually catching up and getting noticed in SLOs. But we got to keep an eye on it, we can't assume that that's the case. And the bug discussion above just points out that we have an underlying problem right now in our metrics measurement. So if we change the measurements to reflect that, then hopefully we're in good shape, if we don't. And if we flatline and address it so that we flatline on S1s and S2s, you will see a temporary jump in SLOs and as we clear out that backlog over that period of time. And I have point C, which is similar to infrastructure, we need to get more security work prioritized. We're hearing that from the team, but either that problem or that activity is sort of currently reflected in our security metrics. So we have some work to do. The long term to make sure that we see things like that in the metrics and the measurements that we're making. Back to you Jack. Yes, go ahead. So, the lower MR rate seems significantly below target, and maybe I hope that would bounce back from December. I think it bounced back, but not back on target. Any context there? What's going on? With family and friends' days, we actually had some heavier vacation days in January compared to historically have, one thing to note is that we are actually at a higher MR rate if you go back the last 18 months, we're actually at a higher near MR rate that we were back in each month this year. So if you compare October to October, November to November, December and January, I'm sorry October, November, December, and January comparatively to last year, what you'll find is we're between a half-point and a 1.5 MR rate above where we were in the month of the previous year. That's great context. Thank you, Christopher. Good work, yeah. So the expectation is that in February is a short month, we were at I think 16 workdays with friends and family day and other things. Obviously, us having power outages in Texas doesn't help things either for the folks who are working in Texas. But hopefully, the rest of the team is being effective. I was hoping to see a better result right now, but the four or five days particularly around release week, that's usually when we do see a little bit higher activity. So that's not accounted for yet, but you know March's merch is when I'm expecting to see a real rebound much like we did last year. Awesome, thanks. The other context I'll give is that we now do time series targets. So when we change the target, you'll see that reflected in the line. So if we were to look back historically here, the goal here was actually lower and Christopher was ambitious",
    "t-NF5fNOyo8": "Oh, attention! Hey Albert! Hey! Hey, does it still take you a while to join meetings? Like, do you have to join like two minutes early just to get Zoom going still or is it much faster? It's not immediate like five seconds or ten seconds, okay, it's fine. Cool. Mark second because he's in the document. Hey Remy! Hey everyone! I say we go ahead and get started. I see Mark's in the doc, I'm sure he'll join here soon.\n\nIn the spirit of Remy coming back, I thought it would be fun to talk about a memorable trip or vacation people have taken. Mine, I think I will remember this for quite some time. In March, when I went to Aruba with my wife, it was right as the pandemic was starting and we kind of were waffling about going. It was great, Aruba is like an island in the Caribbean, so beaches, sun, things that we don't get to experience around here. Super fun! But as we came back, that was when everything was shutting down in the US, and that's pretty much our only memory of the trip, is we came back and the pandemic was unfolding in the US. I was talking with my wife about that this weekend, now it's kind of soured the trip, but it was fun when we were there, but it'll be memorable for a different reason.\n\nRemy, what about you?\n\nUm, about me, I love road trips and I did some road trips with one of my best friends a few years ago. We went to Canada, in the Quebec part of Canada, and we did I don't know how many, but like four or five national parks. So hiking, obviously, and also we went to see whales in the Saguenay River, basically just between the river and the sea. So, yeah, that's a really cool memory. And the next year, we did another road trip with the same friend in Scotland, and that was also super fun. So, yeah, road trips are always fun. Like this year as well, I went to Italy, that was awesome, but yeah, I did many road trips so I wouldn't go to details for each one.\n\nMark, what about you?\n\nMy most memorable would be India, so I spent two weeks in India. I think it was maybe about seven years ago now; but that was one of the first trips that I'd taken outside of Europe and it was just amazing. It was so different and just experiencing that for the first time. But we traveled to maybe, I think, about six or seven different towns, traveling on the trains there because the trains in India are really cool. They've got different classes so you can sleep on there for the overnight trains or some of the short ones there's not any beds. But we were on all sorts of different trains and the trains themselves are a really, really cool experience. But we traveled down most of the west coast and then back up again. It was only two weeks but it felt really, really long and we saw a lot of what they had in the south, including the backwaters which is just like lots of palm trees and lots of open water just set back from the coast. It's really beautiful, but that was especially memorable for me.\n\nIs it Albert next?\n\nYeah, so like four years ago, my wife and I went to Japan, so that was very memorable because we went there for the Tokyo Marathon and the Tokyo Marathon is known to be very difficult to get. So people need to apply and there will be a ballot to tell you whether you get an entry into the race or not, and we both tried on the first attempt and we got it. So it was quite memorable because we know friends who have tried three or four times and they couldn't get an entry at all. So, yeah, it was fun. And it also because there's a lot of training leading up to it so it makes the trip more worthwhile, I would say. So we went there and then followed by like one and a half weeks of vacation after that, just going to different parts of Japan. The travel is really good there, so very accessible, we could get from one city to another in one or two hours, so saves a lot of time. Alright, attention!\n\nOh, I didn't travel a lot and so I think the most memorable... Not sure if it's most memorable but at least it is a significant one that for the first city that I visited outside my country. Something I enjoyed it. I went; that's my first time in Goa, India to Australia. That's quite different because that's my first time which I really traveled alone. Because previously, I always just come with someone and people bring me there, I didn't do anything. So that's my first time I really handled my trip and probably also other trips. Because the last time to Greece, that's my first time to Europe, and it's much different Mexico. I ever thought about going to Mexico and things like that, cool thanks for sharing everyone. Albert, really cool to hear about the Tokyo Marathon, I had no idea, that's really, really cool. So I'll move into the announcements.\n\nTry to move pretty quick here, I did want to pass on my thanks for being really flexible last week. It was a kind of a strange week for me, being without power and internet. I liked to the it's called a directo; it's a storm I had never heard of until it hit us which is a very 2020 thing to happen. Like year 2020, I feel like. Essentially a category two hurricane that went across the whole state. So I was watching TV before the power went out here and there was going to be some severe thunderstorms. They're like, well, it's really building and it might produce a tornado.  The power went out and it was just the devastation in the article that I looked at, the damage is pretty bad. It's about,  I think, 80 kilometers wide, consistent with speeds above 120 kilometers an hour. So just the power went out for four or five hundred miles. I don't know what that is in kilometers but across the whole state, it was pretty wild. Hopefully never have to experience anything like that again. There are tornadoes common in the middle of the state, I've heard of ones happening in like Colorado and the mountains break it up so it doesn't last as long. In Minnesota, there was one that happened into Canada a few years ago, but nothing that was Iowa, it's flat so there's nothing that is going to break it up. Really, the storm just kind of builds on the airflow itself like that's feeding into it and since there's nothing blocking air in Iowa, it's just flat farmland. The news said a storm like this hasn't happened in like 70 years here. So it's like a generational storm. Hopefully once in a generation. But yeah, thank you everyone for being flexible and kind of catching up easy.\n\nNext item, plan. Let's run a test efficiency challenge. If you didn't see it in Q3, it's tied to their OKRs, I believe, to speed up GitLab's test. Remy pointed this out, called it interesting. I thought I'd share it here. If you have bandwidth and you feel interested in participating, feel free to contribute. I think it would be a good thing to demonstrate we'd like to show how we can support others that are trying to improve the pipeline productivity. Another item if you case you missed it, associated quality weekly Standups, Pm Prioritization is being discussed and changed. The criteria is being changed at the Eng Group offsite. If you haven't given that issue a read, please do. It's relating to changing from, I think, stages per user and SMU to monthly active usage and it's going to really kind of change the focus, the decision-making within the product. Another reminder, our pipeline calls DRI as we're working through things and you're finding inefficiencies please consider our Q3, okay or our Q3 KR to improve this and maybe if there's something small or boring solution feel free to fix it as you're doing your work.\n\nTwo more quick reminders, team meetings are recorded and uploaded to Google Drive. I have not been uploading to Unfiltered but plan to do that after today's recording gets uploaded. And the last item, I didn't really see this broadcasted anywhere so this came up in a One-On-One earlier. Jamfis is supposed to start. I haven't seen communication that has started an opt-in pilot this week and we'll run it for a month just to see how it works with developers and our software. I linked to where I saw it communicated the clearest, but something to just be aware of and keep an eye on.\n\nOkay. All right, into the agenda. I wanted to welcome back Remy! I thought your trip sounded cool, driving through the country with a Tesla sounded really, really fun. Welcome back, we're all happy to have you here. \nYeah, thanks, yeah, that's was fun. The mode that makes essentially acceleration super fast that I think it's like turbo or something like that, it's got like yeah, like the sport mode. And my friend has the performance model Model 3, so it goes from zero to 100 kilometers in something like three seconds, it's just amazing. You have to leave it to believe it, that's pretty cool. It's also great that you could get through with an electric vehicle, just road tripping that's yeah, actually there's a lot of superchargers along the way, and it's the Tesla that tells you like when to stop and where to stop. It's optimizing like everything so it's really convenient and it was pretty wild already.\n\nGotcha. Cool, welcome back, the next item. I just wanted to point out I feel that I've done a really poor job clarifying priorities especially the last two, three weeks and wanted to use this as an opportunity to kind of talk through how I see things and any discussion related to this. I kind of ranked our KRs as well as some other work streams so I have the wider community efficiency KR is the most important because it's a pass-through KR so it's from Engieering to quality to our team, so that should be the item that we give the most attention and is probably the most important to complete within our KRs. The next item is dog food, improving the test file finder and reducing the cost per pipeline.\n\nI hope my rewrites make the text more readable and understandable. Let me know if you need anything else!",
    "GgnkH3uih4o": "I am the Executive Vice President of Engineering, and this is the September 22, 2020 Engineering Key Review. We will be covering four of the six engineering departments here. Development, Quality, Security, UX Support, and Infrastructure have their own key reviews. We will try to direct comments to those meetings when appropriate. I know we had the Infrastructure Key Review this morning, and there's one actually that was directed to this meeting about development.\n\nChristopher has a conflict about halfway through and has to leave early, so if we could put questions for Christopher about development up high on the agenda. So maybe Christopher, do you want to elevate item number six on the agenda to number four? Sure, are we on item four? Yes, okay, do I just vocalize it? Yeah sure. I'm sorry, I thought I did it.\n\nEverything else was FYI, sorry about that. So there was a request that we have the largest contentful paint marked as a KPI. Right now, what we've done in the short term for the first iteration is we are getting this in Grafana and added it to the handbook under performance indicator. It will point to a page with five charts of the different pieces we are looking at improving. Right now, it shows the median. We'll need to change that to the 75th percentile. Our plans are to pipe it into the data lake and once it's there, get it to the 75th percentile and then break it out into the five pieces.\n\nWe also moved centralized handbook-first engineering indicators that complete the overall view of development, quality, and UX. These are drilled down into every sub-department in engineering, including metrics from counterparts of UX and quality. Craig, this is where you'll be passionate about the bugs because now you see the drill-down bugs all the way down. If you click on the metrics, we also factor in security and infrastructure as well. Going forward, as the next iteration, we want full transparency open for everybody to see and we have a few more in progress as well.\n\nIn point B two three, Lily is working hard on auditing all our KPIs to make sure it is standardized. We want to measure Mr. Err. We're now working on how to track this as a backhouse ledger because we need to know which accounts are submitting a mark. If you don't have that knowledge, you need to be working with a community relationship team to put these out. We will continue to build on the centralized handbook-first metrics overall. I'll pause there for questions from the group.\n\nAmazing progress, Mac. I think we made you our data czar two or three weeks ago, and this is a huge increase in a huge volume of work that was delivered. A bunch of stuff that's exciting in progress. I would want to call out 5A, the gearing ratio for our stats. Our target is at 42, and I believe we only have 15 or 16 S-dents in general. So we need help in this regard and increasing the coverage in the S-dent space. My gut check is it also correlates with the testing and the bugs as well.\n\nAs headcount requests become a thing, we're at 38 of our target here, and this is a really important area because this makes our software robust for enterprise customers. I think in terms of how we got here, we deliberately limited this one because when we first set the gearing ratio, our team was not possible to grow at 400 percent in a year to hit our gearing ratio. So, in terms of adding new people and hiring them onboard, it means we're not getting back there. We're going to start feeling the pains of that. So we should probably look at the backfills we're doing from kind of organic attrition rather than just backfilling them by default.\n\nMaybe we should take a look at utilizing some of those to increase this gearing ratio by transferring them from one department to another because this is the one gearing ratio for headcount that we're way below. So I think we have to look into fixing that creatively. Should we go to six, Christie?"
