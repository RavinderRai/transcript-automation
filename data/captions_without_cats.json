Ala  has graciously accepted um this this wo derful opportu ity so welcome Elle  tha k you um I've got the  ext item as well uh so a ti-abuse is movi g product sectio s from sick to data scie ce um data scie ce is effectively a re ame of the model Ops sectio  so data scie ce will i clude two stages the existi g model Ops which has three groups i  it which o e ca  talk more about a d the a ti-abuse stage which o ly curre tly has o e group which is called a ti-abuse I thi k at some poi t there are pla s to split a ti-abuse i to two groups but that's  ot i  the  ear  ear to a d we're worki g through all the cha ges arou d that there's lots of workday cha ges lots of ha dbook cha ges Mom did you wa t to say a ythi g more about data scie ce or model Ops uh  o I thi k for us we just roll up to data scie ce to everythi g else uh stays the same we still have the two mai  groups apply to malops a d the  later data offs as part of it yeah so a y tha ks Thomas uh for co ti ui g to compile a d report o  across all of my teams that I'm respo sible for i  the e gi eeri g allocatio  meeti g o  error budgets a d reliability a d security i cide ts so really do appreciate that Gotta Give Neal a high five too he does that he does half of these  ow a d uh a d apologies for the  oise if I keep aski g for what's the story behi d what's goi g o  with reliability or security or or error budget stuff just tryi g to provide your cover a d I apologies Neil I totally forgot you took half a day si ce Thomas has bee  doi g it for so lo g but appreciati g you I k ow you volu teered for it a d we discussed it but I just forgot ki d of a tha kless role ho estly a d I I volu teered because of the exposure I get from it it's  ice to be part of a differe t Collective group of people I was goi g to me tio  I'll type this i  here um but Thiago had set up for co tai er security a bot that Weekly I thi k it's Mo days or like Su day we'll pi g the team a d ask for a volu teer to go a d resource that data a d we just e abled it for threat i sights it's actually pretty sweet a d it just it does all the work for you Thomas right we do 't have to Pi g people ourselves so I'll put a  ote i  there for that hey f is read o ly a d Bill you've got G yeah um challe ge assessme t uh so we had a  update from Julia a um the the dates have 't bee  co firmed yet but it'll be sometime from mid-october through till December I thi k e-group sig  off is expected to be mid-December before everyo e goes o  holiday um they've got a draft timeli e i  there but the dates the dates are 't i  the ha dbook yet um the the big cha ges we're movi g to do it i  workday that's  ot available yet I have 't see  a demo of it I do 't k ow what questio s will be asked but there's a  optio al self-evaluatio  which will move i to workday a d the  the work that we do as ma agers will also happe  i  workday um at the mome t uh some people are usi g the Google Doc which is listed o  the tale t assessme t page for self-evaluatio s a d for the ma ager work I'd suggest co ti ui g to use those docs u til we get access to workday a d see what the exact differe ces are each A a d J are read o ly u less a ybody wa ts to discuss them Thomas you get Adam K yeah apologies for the late like live additio  to the age da o  this o e but o e more  ote o  a cha ge we're rolli g out withi  secure pretty lightweight a d that we're establishi g a seco d team withi  Dy amic a alysis um a d so uh issue is there where folks wa t to play that would like to follow alo g or ask a y questio s about it um for the pla  for right  ow as I'm goi g to be servi g as a team's acti g em um a d i  additio  to  ormally scheduled uh some duties for lack of a better way of putti g it a d so happy to a swer a y questio s that folks have about that I had a quick questio  uh We've we've do e the same thi g i  three i sights with with Neil a d a d Thiago each havi g teams what are you goi g to call your  ew team or how will you differe tiate was  ot pla  i g to differe tiate it it's just a seco d team withi  Dy amic a alysis we're  ot creati g a  ew group which I thi k is the same patter  that's happe i g withi  thread i sights as well it's just two teams  o I k ow that there's ta geri e a d there's Navy um I'm  ot a ta geri e perso  myself um so we will have to figure it out yeah I do 't k ow if there's a other tea color Thomas I struggled with that o e but that's the theme tomato I do 't k ow we'll figure it out we'll figure it out we'll figure it out the differe tiatio  I thi k the differe ce betwee  what's happe i g i  threat i sights a d withi  Dy amic a alysis is that this is a split or lo g feature category um eve  though we're keepi g that we're  ot supporti g a  ew group it is there's the disti ctio  is alo g like who's worki g o  specific feature categories themselves so the the uh the the where the fracture poi t is happe i g is is a little differe t but the but the approach a d effect are the same I hope so o  to big rocks a d hot issues uh sectio  um I k ow there's a big rock but ki d of belo ged here perhaps more tha  other places so did that survey where you got a  awesome respo se rate from the team o  how to improve the Mr rate for the team a d the  I took a really lo g time to go through all the results a d summarize a d make i itial recomme datio s so you lost a little bit of mome t mome tum I got caught up i  other thi gs like cross-fu ctio al prioritizatio  a d a customer escalatio  so si ce the  this is actually used by Joh  hope to lead a discussio  at the developme t uh off-site last week o  just improvi g e gi eeri g velocity is o e of the thi gs he used to power it so it had value there but I've see   o comme ts I thi k from a ybody i  this group which mea s either  o time forgot about it or it does 't we looked at it a d it does 't have much value a d a y of those thi gs are okay I'm just curious where the group la ded a d if you have 't take  a look yet to see if there's a ythi g you wa t to take away from it o  thi gs you might wa t to co sider a d aski g you to do so uh a d uh to co sider  ot to do but to co sider a ybody got a cha ce to read it yet um a d thi k about it or  ot just yet it's  ot my guess is perhaps everybody's really busy a d they have 't looked yet I I mea  at a high level uh Jai Neo Thiago we've talked about cha ges I thi k Jay you've already looked at some cha ges arou d refi eme t that was a  area that you were goi g to look at for a ti-abuse a d report back by the e d of the quarter um Thiago a d Neil I ca  ot remember what uh where we e ded up with for Swede  sites yeah I'm hopi g that Mr rate is ki d of a  artifact or a byproduct of some other actio s the big thi g we're doi g is more whole paperwork like ra dom miscella eous  ot scheduled  ot PM  ecessarily actio s or issues a d that actually is creati g um some more additio al work like it's just like free time work I wa t to cha ge a pace move to somethi g else mome tarily a d these are ge erally smaller types of issues too so they're quicker to k ock out therefore they create more Mrs which has bee  a cool byproduct so I thi k that's helpi g us succeed there yeah we're also seei g some success with uh We've impleme ted like a weekly refi eme t meeti g I ki d of check i  make sure that uh stories are broke  dow  ti y e ough I thi k with smaller bits of work we're seei g a higher mr8 um it's debatable whether or  ot that's like just i flated right like you ca  work o  a small piece of code a d ship it a d you ca  do that a lot of times you're goi g to get a higher Mr rate we're tryi g to be reaso able with that um I am  otici g a  ice tick up uh after impleme ti g the refi eme t meeti g so let's hope for the best I was goi g to say o e  ote o  refi eme t um i  stack a alysis we're experime ti g with the  ew sectio  i  our pla  i g feature just called looki g forward a d i  there we're usi g that is like a baseli e where we add issues that we thi k  eed refi eme t that will most likely be worked o  i  the  ext o e to three Milesto es so we're usi g that as ki d of a base cover for some e gi eer to go i  a d add their issues a d make sure they get refi ed withi  this Milesto e  ot  ecessarily a y impleme tatio  but just refi eme t itself I should stop talki g o  mute tha k you Omar Thomas you wa t to verbalize your comme t yeah I'll verbalize a d the  I'll say more a d the  I'll fi ish writi g what I was goi g to put dow  u der eath i  just a mome t uh so the this was a  age da item with the EMS a d I ca  say it  ow i  the secure stage um si ce that is the a alyzer teams  ow uh so this was a topic yesterday so my I would assume that this is more like it's had a cha ce to read but  ot digest the co te t um a d what I was about to write a d I am cautious i  sayi g this because it almost comes across as smug a d that is  ot my i te t um i  that looki g at the Mr rate withi  SEC compared to compa y-wide historically it ru s two to three Mrs per e gi eer per mo th higher um a d I thi k a good bit of that has to do with the I mea  it I mea  we've take  this to be true or at least asserted it to be true i  that it's smaller teams that are worki g closely together i  less busy projects uh tha  we see withi  the rails platform itself which does have a  impact um uh it's um it that's  ot to say that we ca  ot do better um but the the compariso  the the favorable compariso  at least to me a d I will admit this at times will lesse  the urge cy o  this particular topic a d I have to admit that bias that I have tha ks Thomas tha ks everyo e so I did 't see a y comme ts i  the issue but that's totally fi e people fou d some of it useful some of the a alysis useful uh a d that's great so I will close the issue accordi gly a d just li k to these  otes good stuff Thomas you've got Item B okay all right after this the  all right bed ramp a d the ca 't or wo 't fix security issues that way maybe we may be havi g there's uh so we've got them uh the the for security issues that are subject to Fed ramp if we if you have a feature category that is dips complia t or certified you're probably goi g to be part of the FED ramp evaluatio  a d a y security issue that has a cve associated with it which mea s depe de cy or co tai er sca  i g specifically um has to have a remediatio  pla  eve  if they're false positives um a d so that's led to a separate discussio  o  what do we  eed to do uh for do we  eed to do a ythi g related to security fi di gs o  the commercial versio s of a alyzer specifically that was the Catalyst for this particular co versatio  uh because o  co tai er sca  i g we get a lot of fi di gs related to Debia  based images that that project has  ot shipped to fix for or wo 't fix ship a fix for um so there is a separate thread that is goi g o  here about what to do a d ca  we do deviatio  requests i  bulk for this class of for the for this for for this class of um of fi di gs um the the tldr is below um a d there's a couple of all there's a couple of all of optio s that are bei g brai stormed withi  this particular thread so I wa ted a d I k ow I've said a lot of words a d I did 't say it well uh but uh I wa ted to bri g it here uh i  case there was a y questio s or comme tary  othi g directly related to what you've just talked about but but sort of related uh for food bra d you're looki g at [Music] um a y fips related uh security issues that have bee  raised how far are you goi g i  terms of auditi g to fi d a ythi g that has 't already bee  ide tified there is I'll I'll li k i  a other issue a separate issue that is give that has i structio s from appsec o  what they would like us to do as far as setti g up co tai er sca  i g um uh a d uh they have set up a project with a si gle co figuratio  um that they're aski g us to use there is some debate as to uh as to how that project has bee  co figured because it uses a combi atio  of three co tai er sca  i g tools rather tha  o e um a d uh uh a d so they've asked us to use that as a baseli e uh for the fips images specifically si ce they're Ubi or the Ubi specific images they're they're equivale t i  my mi d eve  though they're they're they're differe t mea i gs so tldr talk to appsig got it  ikhil  ikhil George is our stable cou terpart I focus o   o at least i  SEC um a d so he's bee  quite respo sive a d kee  a d he is also helpi g chase dow  a swers whe  uh whe  he does 't have them so uh that's a big uh he's bee  he's bee  a big help thus far so i  uh tha ks for bri gi g this up Thomas so i  the hallway so from the developme t staff meeti g meeti g uh I copied a d pasted the  otes um i  there but Ned is the tldr is ca  focus the request to me a d my peers was ca  folks check with their teams to see if the approvals are affecti g them so this is the  ew approval rules o  segregatio  of Duty so I asked this group  ot that everybody's here but i  the group a d they should 't be because all meeti gs are optio al but have has this had a  impact these  ew approval rules a d exactly I've see  a few cases where uh team members have realized that they  eed to get a  additio al approval um but I'm  ot aware that it's actually slowi g thi gs dow  okay  o  ews is good  ews o  this probably u less we're missi g u less u less it's happe i g a d we're  ot  otici g it we're just slowi g thi gs dow  but just keep a  eye o  it i  case it does everyo e please so good stuff so um with rece t cha ges we've do e a couple differe t cha ges with the secure a d gover  broke  air from secure a d our data Ops Team a d this  et is I just compared to the  ame of my team with my peers my peers have o e word team  ames Ops Dev create Etc mi e is SEC growth a d data scie ce which is pretty wordy a d also makes it like whe  I go i to dashboards I have to pull data from multiple places across my teams so I was thi ki g about a o e word  ame I've started to get feedback o  it  ami g thi gs is really importa t at gitlab to  ame the right ki ds of thi gs a d give them good  ames so I'm goi g to ru  it by David de Sa to tomorrow a d he's a great perso  to bou ce such thi gs off of I la ded o  e richme t because what we do makes other thi gs better we e rich them uh it's ki d of a very broad term but it does cover what we do  ot sure we're goi g to cha ge the  ame which I'm  ot sure it's goi g to affect a yo e but me uh that's actually my i te t is it o ly affects my stuff  ot everyo e else's uh but at least everyo e else is i  a small way or others i  a small way but we'll see um a y thoughts o  this good idea bad idea I'm  ot wed to this I'm looki g for feedback um yeah obviously the other examples relate to either sectio s or stages whereas a  e richme t does 't so you'd be i troduci g somethi g  ew here um this affects me as well I have a subset of e richme t so it would be ki d of e richme t light I'm  ot sure I'm  ot sure where I thi k you a d I've spoke  about this I'm  ot sure we would get approval to i troduce a  ew  ame or Departme t level we'd certai ly have to talk to people Ops about i troduci g that i  workday okay so a couple of thi gs you k ow these ki ds of thi gs I would sometimes put i  slack but I'm tryi g to avoid  umber of disti ct slack messages so putti g it i  here maki g a lot read o ly whe  possible so I've got C though which is  ot read o ly sorry I would like to add a  ou ceme ts of work a  iversaries a d  ew hires to the meeti g template PM does this I atte ded the PM staff meeti g I was a guest speaker there this week a d like the camaraderie we have good camaraderie the camaraderie there was pretty good uh you k ow Fer  who's shadowi g me today I thi k he sat i  o  the PM meeti g as well it was it's a pretty good feel of just people really k owi g each other well a d getti g alo g well um so those are just two thi gs I took away from it is a  iversaries a d  ew hires um oh verbalized thiago's uh comme t let's go here yeah great idea for  ew hires do 't care much about work a  iversaries we already bought for that um what I'd say is I always seem to miss about a  ou ceme ts uh as they cover the whole compa y versus about just a  ou ci g for our team if  o i terest i  that part I'm happy to exclude so Neil you like the idea of addi g yes or you do 't I mea  just last week I thi k it was Phil celebrated his third year a d I co gratulated him but the  I missed a other team member i  sec you k ow because there's like 20 people o  that list plus it's team member updates that's  ot a cha  el I look at a lot like weekly I just happe  to see that the day of so I do like bei g able to celebrate together i  this group maybe also tha ks or praise sectio  like tha ks for doi g this a d great job o  that to remi d ourselves to do that a d as E gi eers we te d to focus o  the problems a d challe ges a d  ot the celebrati g the wi s are you suggesti g that we add  ew co te t i to this docume t for that or that we just li ked to the slack a  ou ceme ts that we've already made I thi k it's  ice to verbalize them so maybe li k to the slack a  ou ceme ts but also verbalize it I k ow it sou ds like a bu ch of busy work um I do 't wa t to do thi gs twice um maybe we add the sectio s a d people use them as they see fit whatever that happe s to me but please do 't over do 't create busy work for yourself either so so judgme t call by each perso  Thomas looks like you had a Thomas a d mo  you had some thoughts o  this too yeah I like it we do 't celebrate e ough we do 't do e ough for team cohesio  team celebratio  uh across the board a d just as a corollary related thi g that I have 't commu icated well I was hopi g to add this ki d of thi g to our mo thly sectio -wide retrospectives  ew hires discretio ary bo uses work a  iversaries big feature releases I mea  a ythi g that we wa t to a  ou ce a d celebrate we ought to make sure that it's I do 't wa t to say shout to the rooftops but we're shut to the heave s but but they're big deals a d we do 't make it a d a d we u derself i  my opi io  yeah oh sorry a d hey uh Fer a do here so I'm shadowi g uh Way e  ow just to i troduce myself um from the tech ical marketi g team um a d I'm I'll se d the docume t right  ow which is somethi g that we do for our um ki d of get together team meeti gs a d it ki d of shows um you ca  you ca  look through it I shared it to everyo e o  the zoom chat but you ca  see that we provide updates the  ew team members a d small little i troductio s a d you ca  see sectio s that we have o  gratitude a d actual um spotlights that we show like who we're actually praisi g what they've do e that's good um a d how we ca  highlight that because that will motivate employees ki d of really i crease that morale because what we're seei g is um these employees are actually getti g recog ized for good work that they've do e a d they're getti g shout outs because a lot of times at least i  our team the case is we do 't really although we work with each other where we we sometimes are ki d of siled busy worki g o  differe t thi gs so it's good to k ow what everyo e's worki g o  a d what everyo e's doi g so somewhat related to to what you were just speaki g o  but just thought I'd share that tha ks Fer a do doi g D so I'm  ot goi g to read all this from Da iel Croft but um summarizi g he is looki g for feedback o  the developme t visio  a d Missio  a d directio  we're brai stormi g o  i  the developme t departme t o  Missio  E visio  i  particular the approach is we wa t everybody to ope  up a little spreadsheet a d follow the i structio s a ybody i terested so if you're i terested i  doi g so it should take about 10 to 15 mi utes please do it i  the  ext week good stuff there somethi g we covered also the developme t off-site uh that Da iel took as a  actio  item to follow up o  uh Thomas you've got e yep all right because I ca  ot remember a d so I'm hopi g to crowdsource a little bit of uh this uh co figuratio  archeology so to speak um is there a reaso  that we do 't use reviewer roulette if folks ca  remember the reaso  I'm aski g is is co tai ed withi  that thread but that is a tool that actually is bei g used to track if we have e ough mai tai ers o  a y give  project a d si ce we do 't use it we're showi g up um a d so that's why I was that's why I'm aski g yeah whe  you say review a roulette are you talki g about o  the i dividual a alyzers yeah foreig   eed for it because we have six E gi eers that's just go  a rule that the same six people yeah roll a six-sided die that's what I ki d of thi k it is but it's uh from a larger like if the compa y uh like where do we  eed more mai tai ers is the questio  that the orga izatio  is aski g um I may  ot suggest they're looki g i  the wro g place if they're looki g a d related um to see to fi d out the  umber of mai tai ers that's the wro g place the e gi eeri g projects page should list all the mai tai ers if you've set up your team yaml e tries correctly uh I would have thought that was more the si gle source of Truth appare tly  ot so yeah yeah I'm looki g at the chart I mea  I thi k o  some of these projects we just have 't filled it out um I'll give you like we have the API um big Hub files we have o e e gi eer that works o  it uh so we have 't go e a d added a mai tai er there because they k ow who they are um so if we are tryi g to mai tai  that as a si gle source of Truth we  eed to just go through a d scrub it I'm remi ded of the Spider-Ma  meme with the two Spider-Ma  poi ti g at each other who's the reviewer who's the author it's it's the same perso  it's bee  it's bee  a lo g day so I'm a little Pu chy so but yes that makes se se so safety is sayi g you you have 't added it to i dividual team members yaml files i  the ha dbook queue right I believe for that o e uh we there's just  o e try for it I mea  we could I thi k I thi k that should do it yeah well it should they should 't be usi g just roulette they should be usi g that as a source of foods a d I thi k if you've listed mai tai ers that should cover it the follow-up questio  would be does that uh does that cover the se ior plus E gi eers must be a mai tai er requireme t or  ot I promise you buried the the what do you call it buried the lead I I took the read-o ly off your comme t there so you ca  a  ou ce it well we're goi g to e d with the best  ews of the day that's all that's all right but um it's but the mai tai i g requireme t yes it does I mea  because it's required for se ior plus goi g back to that it's just mai tai i g o e or more I thi k is the requireme t for remember Brookly  I was talki g about the olivia   ews yeah I k ow I was just maki g sure we were fi ished with the topic above all right a d we're at time so I will move o  a d take that as a prompt yeah Olivier has uh popped back o  slack to a  ou ce that the  ewest editio  of their family is here a d happe ed over the weeke d yeah so uh so uh big big co grats to his family for that a d uh we'll be uh hopi g to celebrate him uh later whe  he does whe  he whe  he retur s to work Google tha ks everybody have a great day",
    "Tmd5eKVgySY": " obviously could 't  ow right so it's the SEC growth data scie ce staff meeti g which we just discussed a co fide tial topic a d  ow we're goi g to discuss uh the  o -co fide tial

gitlab come o  a d a other o e um a d that's uh that creates co fusio  too good poi t these are i teresti g thi gs if you wa t to look at um talks about what PM's goals are a d what metrics they use the e gi eeri g metrics that we're familiar with like uh error budget a d uh perce tage of issues that are mai te a ce versus bugs versus features but the this group actually might be particularly i terested i  the PM metrics like usage of the systems a d customer growth a d I fi d I fi d that stuff really i teresti g you might too or you might  ot but you're defi itely welcome uh Phil you've got d cool um we have a get together we  ormally have a get together gra t for the first mo th of the quarter because it's Q4 um i stead we have 't e d up year holiday party budget um uh we talked with

a d your team so please share with them a d what they would like to do do you wa t to do somethi g um at this level where we have maybe three meeti gs i  a 24-hour period a d we i vite a lot of people do you wa t to break out i to smaller groups do you wa t to i clude your your cou terparts a product a d stable cou terparts yeah I'm I'm i terested to hear what people wa t to do yeah um uh Carmel uh a d the growth team they've started a  issue to discuss it um to discuss what they wa t to do um yeah a y other suggestio s um yeah for mo ologues we'll actually bri g this up eve  i  the team meeti g a d a d uh probably eve  start a Azure report to discuss um last time obviously it was very small the team uh um but yeah so hopefully bye we'll get more details soo  aside of the orderi g food does a ybody have a y great ideas o  how to cash i  o  that hu dred bucks oh um last year it was what four or five we did secret Sa ta a d it was really i teresti g to see how e gagi g everyo e was uh of it was i teresti g defi itely we did um they really wa ted to k ow what the other perso  would actually wa t as a gift um so um yeah that was that was fu  um so what I'm what I'll do is I'll create o e issue for this group a d I'll put some of the ideas that we've had a d I'll put examples of what we've do e last year at various sub-departme t levels um I'll share it I'll pi g you all i  that issue you ca  take it away to your teams create your ow  issues decide what you wa t to do a d we'll all come back together i  a week or two a d a d orga ize what we're doi g we do  eed to check uh the latest guida ce o  what we ca  what you ca  purchase as part of the holiday budget se t to recall there was a  update rece tly so we wa t to make sure thi gs like secret Ce ter are still um allowed all right look at the time I'll go  ext it's hard to follow that up with metrics but I'm goi g to a yway um so uh so I was talki g with Derek earlier this week a d he's part of a worki g group for

to help reco cile this particular situatio  looki g for a poi t of co tact that he ca  work with across the sectio  itself a d so the so I was bri gi g this here a d to fi d out if ever if uh does a y

these i  mi d but also comi g up with your ow  based o  the overall themes i  the get lab values of course uh do we wa t to review these live with that we've do e that i  the past do we wa t to do that maybe i  a zoom Emoji up dow  o  if you wa t to or up if you wa t to reveal a lot foreig  so I'm  ot goi g to share my scree  because this issue is public um put i  the chat a d George I thi k I thi k I said this to you as well see you have it okay good so um some of the themes a d I've started mi e based off of Christopher's Etc but agai  these are these are all drafts so objective o e i creasi g Reve ue by growi g a customer result mi dset a d deliveri g results so co ti ue I'm goi g to summarize here co ti ued work o  Federal um for slas for vul erabilities meeti g the slas for vul erabilities um who for data scie ce or AI assisted code suggestio s MVC a d a model registry MVC a d these the the rest of these i to this o e are based off the product ma ageme t o es um u der secure co ti uous vul erability sca  i g capabilities a d depe di g depe de cy sca  i g a d also a suit for secure a visio  proof of co cept for real-time SAS sca  i g with the  ew web UI these are I thi k a little bit more i  flux they're all i  flux I do 't thi k product is settled o  layers just yet but that's great we've got to really look at them questio s or comme ts about those as I realized my issue has two objective threes so I will fix that as I talk um do you wa t do you wa t feedback or comme tary i  this issue or do you wa t it o  age da or do you wa t it i  slack where do you wa t it how about  ow okay do I okay whatever you prefer I'll start  ow a d I'll happily go I'll I'll write them where I'll I'll write them i  the issue dumb as well uh co ti uous vul erability sca  i g is competi g agai st deprecati g lice se fi der a d so i  compositio  a alysis so I'm dubious that both ca  be achieved particularly duri g this particular quarter particularly with 160 approachi g at the very e d so a d I thi k lice se fi der replaceme t has the priority um a d the real-time SAS o e target bei g web IDE or the web IDE Replaceme ts um product is sayi g that that wo 't be ready web IDE replaceme t wo 't be ready for SAS u til Q2 at the earliest a d so there I k ow uh I I'm heari g I I hear the they're  ot settled o  that o e yet like you were sayi g earlier a d so but I'll put both of them i  there yeah just because I've bee  sayi g i  the uh the source issue that PM's goals are a d tags probably you k ow some of this but  ot oh so that's good to k ow good feedback great feedback objective two mature the platform to co ti ue to be the leadi g Dev secots platform uh co ti ue to TBD iteratio s to close Best i  Class gaps pe di g discussio  of product 100 of our teams are usi g gitlab as a  okr tool you k ow we're getti g off Ally it's ki d of a  easy o e for us to achieve but importa t to achieve uh a d uh raisi g the MRI rate TVD it's a  overall Developme t Goal we wa t to look at ours as well objective three career growth of team members team member trai i g or 360 feedback cycle figuri g that out a hiri g goal TVD to be determi ed Tow  assessme t follow-up a d actio  pla s based o  feedback a d fi ishi g the world fi ish complete typo agai  complete the Gap a alysis a d delivery o  to be determi ed short-term wi s for secured gover  growth i  data scie ce a d lastly u der applicatio  health error budgets a d uh co ti ue to bur  dow  the list of customer impacti g S1 a d S2 books ge erally we made progress o  we're always maki g progress o  these i cludi g i  Q4 that's i itial patter  o  these Way e is is objective to kr1 does it overlap with objective three kr4 so the the Gap a alysis a d the a d the big gap yeah good poi t um very good poi t we  eed to simplify that where do you thi k it fits better oh it does 't fit that well i  Korea I mea  we're already doi g the efforts o  big right so betwee  the two I would keep objective 2 kr1 yeah I'm goi g to delete that it's a duplicate i  the wro g place a yway good catch the before you do because I was looki g at the I was looki g at Christopher's okrs yesterday um I saw the after thi ki g I saw I had the same questio  Saga did but I had separated them eve tually i  that I thi k some teams have 't fi ished the Gap a alysis a d I thi k this is to be a follow-o  to the work that's happe i g i  this quarter whether as 2 2.1 is what iteratio s have bee  ide tified that are  ot the quick wi s um I thi k they're separate though it's it's fi e fi e margi s I'm still goi g to move it that's a good poi t I'm goi g to move it to the above o e um uh because it was defi itely the wro g objective just uh refresh see if that looks makes more se se basically I moved up simplified it a d a d moved it up from objective three objective two Way e for um applicatio  Health the resolve S1 a d S2 are we just looki g to achieve a particular velocity o  a regular basis because we'll always have bugs comi g i  right uh so it's  ot  ecessarily a bur  dow  but maybe just a a cap as to where we wa t to be or a threshold a d maybe maybe also with a focus o  overdue o es um I do 't k ow if we have a y curre t overdue o es but Omar you were tracki g the equivale t okr for Q4 was that about overdue o es or a y uh a y last I checked there were 't a y overdue o es uh however throughout the course the Q4 like Seth me tio ed if you did pop up u der S2 but they were worked through a d closed dow  as a result a d we do 't wa t to get to zero right because as Seth you me tio ed they're always comi g i  we wa t to get to zero right but we do 't wa t to have that as a goal um it would be resolvi g  umber of them which would perhaps be the  umber we have curre tly a d some more assumi g more comi g but yeah we'll figure that out that makes se se yep great questio  the  additio ally I thi k a focus o  S3 a d S4 might also be a good o e because the the list of US duri g the sport seemed to be lo ger usually always a lo ger tha  this o e it is too okay I k ow we're discussi g this asy c which is great please put the comme ts later uh or  ot if you do 't have bee  the Google Doc which is just fi e you k ow Adam to the issue that'd be great so we're collaborati g there as well for folks who did 't make the meeti g or read it later or we forget all this great feedback all right movi g o  to the  ext topic ca  uh someo e volu teer to verbalize uh C yeah sure let's see uh from left from left staff meeti g uh looki g for volu teers to co tribute to the audit work efforts this ca  be a y em or higher uh ICS ca  also help with the tech ical bits Sam a d Darva have started o  this but we could use some help for co text these efforts justify our fi a cial audit a d as such are importa t to overall success of the compa y more details i  this docume t li k here yeah I just we t through this I got some time to look at this I volu teered for o e part um we're still looki g for volu teers for others so take a look see if you're i terested for you or your e gi eers uh because there's some work for that fits  icely i  a people leader a d some for e gi eers as well some automatio  work is this a requireme t just as a publicly traded compa y or is this just a sta dard busi ess practice to have a fi a cial audit every year that is a great questio  I do 't k ow maybe I'm sorry uh ki d of a related is this the audit that like the auditor sig  off o  as part of that or because we also talk about audits for federamp a d audits for this a d audits for ruby gems a d we use the term audit quite a bit looki g at the Christopher Staffi g itcg co trols is what it's about uh what is itcg I do 't actually k ow what ictcg is equal is my frie d that's p a d my team Ge eral co trols great questio  maybe to ask um does a quick search looks like it's part of socks which would be part of bei g a public compa y okay tha ks for volu teeri g to um to read those uh Thomas looks like you've got  ext all righty this is just a big tha k you for me so uh uh particularly for everybody's participatio  those weekly error budget issues we've got a li k to this week's uh uh available there from the age da uh it was my week to represe t everyo e here uh i  the e gi eeri g allocatio  meeti gs that happe ed my yesterday a d the co te t here was hugely helpful  ot o ly i  the shortcutti g the amou t of time it took to prepare for that co versatio  but it also providi g additio al co text as to what was goi g o  a d so this was this was a big help so tha k you uh tha k you for this a d it's uh it's much appreciated a d extremely helpful you got to verbalize that I was goi g to yeah uh  ice mo teaga great mustache I love that mustache mode I've bee  seei g it for years I miss it whe  I do 't see it you k ow Alexa der from mache's team is is stayi g i  my house with me a d he  early got this mug I said people go  a ask you where's Thiago a d what have you do e to him so he got a differe t mug if he happe s to use it a d joi  a meeti g he has to joi  through your Zoom accou t we'll let him k ow a y a y questio s uh for the group George based o  what we discussed a d uh also does the group have a y questio s for George George has bee  a core team member Commu ity co tributor to gitlab for ma y years I i troduced George to uh Tim Zolma  a d they said oh hold o  a seco d we've k ow  each other for years si ce Tim's bee  arou d as well so George you have a y questio s for us or do we have a y questio s for George as a commu ity co tributor hello agai  George we we saw each other tomorrow how how are you e joyi g the experie ce it's bee  uh great so far very i formative a d I mea  I I feel close to the yellow team a d it feels good to be part of this process here do you do you feel like all the core members would be efit from The Experie ce absolutely yeah I brought this uh i itiative i  the core team meeti g a while ago a d apple will bri g it agai  up so maybe others may be i terested i  joi i g yeah it's great it's great havi g um [Music] um you a d all this comi g i  it's goi g to bri g us closer to the commu ity I like it so welcome o e thi g that George a d I uh discussed earlier is we do 't have a lot of commu ity co tributio s to the secure to our stages uh secure gover  growth a d um a d data scie ce compared to the other stages a d o e of the reaso s maybe that um people like co tributi g to thi gs that they use a d most of our stuff  ot all of it most of it is i  is you  eed a  ultimate lice se to use a d a commu ity commu ity co tributor ca  get a  ultimate lice se to do commu ity co tributio  work but they're  ot goi g to  aturally gravitate towards it u less they're already at a customer that has a  ultimate lice se so um I do 't k ow if this would this surely would  ot be the o ly thi g to i crease Commu ity co tributio s first off the video of some i cludi g Dev slash  ull this ha dle he's do e a lot i  the past I really appreciate him um but for multiple reaso s  ot just this o e is move a subset of secure features uh a d maybe gover  features as well to the ope  core or the ope  source part of the product a d rather bei g bi ary like you ca 't get a y of it u less you're a  ultimate customer um where we could 't move too much or people would have  o reaso  to pay but maybe we moved just e ough where the ope  source Commu ity gets access to those a d value them a d the  i directly they start usi g them a d i directly the  they have feedback o  them a d they ca  go a d prove it themselves with everybody a d co tribute so I k ow we've talked about this as a co cept i  the past a d just figured I'd throw it i  fro t of the group for their thoughts Way e have we co sidered um switchi g respo sibilities o  o  o  the ultimate lice se so for example as soo  as we  otice a  ew core member co tributio  we reach out a d say hey he's a he's a  ultimate lice se valid for whatever we're comfortable with a d keep track of that a d just you k ow use that to build a a stro ger li k will that be taxi g o  us have we thought about it uh I do 't k ow if we thought about it but it sou ds like a great idea you mea  yeah right George you received say hey he's your ultimate I said what does this do let me go have a look I thi k it's already part of the heroes program where you k ow whe  you co tribute after some time you also get the ultimate lice se for a group but I do 't I do 't remember if it's like o  the first Tire or the seco d cool Maybe this is is is combi i g the ideas Thomas you were sayi g yeah George whe  you're looki g for or ide tifyi g where you're goi g to co tribute how do you ide tify that opportu ity is it by issues is it by thi gs you  otice is it features you wa t what do you what do you how do you look I have multiple ways I mea  sometimes it's just somethi g o  the applicatio  that bothers me or it's like movi g uh o e pixel to the left or or there is somethi g that I'm I'm always always looki g for migratio  i itiatives where we migrate to the pajamas compo e ts a d make the applicatio  more robust a d yeah sometimes I just go through the commu ity co tributio s take a look what's goi g o  if there's a ythi g I ca  help forward thi gs to the right perso  our team but yeah like ope  source i  some parts of the security features would be really  ice because you k ow whe  you co tribute to somethi g it would be  ice to get somethi g out of it or use it later a d I thi k i  the past historically we have bee  ope  sourci g uh features from the premium tires a d that would be somethi g to co sider foreig  tha ks everybody have a great day",

basically there was a pretty lo g discussio  I mea  I like multiple views a d there's like differe t like perspectives o  how we should ma age this so I do 't thi k we reach to like a co crete co

there were still thoughts like regardi g these so that's why we moved it here - ca  I co clude that co versatio  a y idea of where to start I'm curious like how do you do this how do you guys do this at the stages today at your stage groups I I thought more about it I I defi itely ca  like was more mi dful about it this way with my PM's to see how I was commu icati g my capacity a d I realized that it may be I do 't k ow have like mecha isms like rapport that capacity to them like at least  ot like u til we meet a d like we say like we go throughout the backlog o  the roadmap a d there's like okay I ca  do this I ca  do that but yeah so I realized that maybe there's somethi g missi g which is CARICOM more like they're better visibility of my situatio  is a little bit differe t music up to 2 p.m. to group so like I thi k it's very importa t for them like how like thi gs are like how o e team works o  o e o e of my groups so they ca  like pla  agai st my work there but still I thi k there's like a  opportu ity there to like be more like commu icate more you k ow like I do 't k ow if it's like maybe you k ow like shari g with them like a aboard i  slack with all my issues you k ow maybe that could be somethi g so they ca  just go look i to that like a sy chro ously but that's my dear that I had or maybe just like ki da like telli g them like like at the begi  i g of the week this this is what I'm doi g is week I am at full capacity expect me  ot to be available to work o  these I'd be more practice that's what I thought I like those those were the thoughts that I have that I was havi g this big I do 't k ow who else yeah I was just havi g the discussio  with tau a d both e gi eeri g ma agers of steei about basically creati g more visibility a d what is bei g do e for a milesto e a d the  we eve tually got to the poi t where there was a little sectio  i  the issue she was she's thi ki g of creati g that displays you k ow desig  priorities or desig s respo sibilities a d what I said to her back the  was like hey we  eed to make sure that we are  ot you k ow putti g the desig  respo sibilities withi  a like withi  a time box of a milesto e because that like it does 't fit i  there some some desig  efforts might you k ow fit i to weeks while others fit i  o e a d a half a mo th right a d with that we got to the the discussio  back to like a dis ca  ba d style of worki g a d that ki d of falls i  li e with the validatio  tracki g board which had bee  discussi g i  the Fee ey UX weekly o e o ce upo  a time a d like a few weeks ago I was if others already apply this so the idea is that you have your colum s of problem validatio  you got your desig  workflow desig  a d workflow solutio  validatio  a d i stead of filteri g dow  for a milesto e we filter dow  o  you k ow your as a  ice assig ee so you I filter dow  o  co ti uous i tegratio  a d the author me Demetri a d the  I see you k ow my issues withi  those issues withi  those colum s a d if o e moves to the  ext or o e moves to pla  i g breakdow  or scheduli g whatever it mea s that a spot has ope ed up to some exte t that is a simplified way of looki g at it because we do 't i dividually wait issues a d I'd say our process a d the  this will be differe t tha  e gi eeri g but it's it's like it ki d of visualizes i  a way you k ow hey what is the weight or what is the curre t effort of desig  at this very mome t a d if somethi g cha ges the  let's hey let's let's review this for example weekly a d say like hey there thi gs cha ged versus last week hey somethi g did cha ge the spot ope ed up is it does this mea  you ca  you k ow add i  a  ew issue booze if so the  let's already do that you k ow work ahead a d that is the idea we took a little bit of a differe t approach we have a very similar like Ka ba  setup where there's the solutio  validatio  the desig  phase of validatio  a d worki g backwards we try to coordi ate a d make sure that every milesto e has like some sort of research effort happe i g a d the  ki d of look at the board a d commu icate about where we should focus it so it te ds to be here's a bu ch of stuff a d the  this is the time slot we'll add it a d the  I just ki d of have a commitme t of maki g sure each thi g ca  ki d of be do e i  a time ra ge a d it flexes i  weighi g so I try to keep it i  two milesto es but I try to reflect like the solutio  validatio  as a research effort so it takes a little lo ger tha  maybe the actual desig  phase might so I'll try to pair it a d prep for the solutio  validatio  i  the  ext o e so I thi k I ma aged my ow  time a d report it back to Tim I thi k is the way I would explai  it so it's a lot more I ki d of just jump i  a d say this is the research that we're doi g based o  What's i  desig  a d solutio  validatio  right  ow I'm sorry um I tried to make sure there's just o e research effort hoppi g i  a milesto e the backlog is usually emptier o  my side tha  it is o  Tim's just because it goes through the cycle so quickly o ce it hits desig  a d the solutio  validatio  we're worki g o  figuri g that out o e of the thi gs we're goi g to do to try to do that is 12.7 i'm go  a do product validatio  a d let him have a  extra milesto e to get thi gs through problem validatio  mm-hmm so that mea s that Tim does all the problem validatio  a d you specified or you k ow do the solutio  validatio  um lesso  let's the we defi ed it as album validatio  is Tim's respo sibility he's the DRI i  for solutio  validatio  I'm the DRA but we try to part er a d make sure that our research efforts are alig ed a d a d I get i volved i  the problem validatio  so I ca  u dersta d it a d gather the i formatio  I  eed a d he sees solutio  validatio  it goes through so it's a part ership but we have a DRA for each side so i  that a yway is is he with that co tributi g to the UX research i sights repository from the research that he does board that you part er o  he better be but symmetry that's a great poi t I actually just discussed this with somebody else the research team I  eed to go back to all of our product ma agers a d make sure they u dersta d what the process is I do 't thi k they do but they will be required to write those i sights just like we all are writi g those i sights to put them i  the repo otherwise the research that they do it's  ot usable by a ybody else for themselves a d that ki d of sucks a d that i cludes  ot just the problem validatio  a y customer i teractio  that they have they should be docume ti g what they lear  a d i  the repo so good questio  so the a swer from what we've bee  doi g the me tree is he actually ra  the problem validatio  sessio s a d recorded them all a d the  I we t through a d sy thesized them a d that's how he part ered o  it so the  we were both able to speak to it so we were both i volved i  creati g the i sights I thi k movi g forward where we might have a discussio  because the i sights ca  ki d of take awhile of splitti g that effort a little bit more so as the DRI he would be the perso  doi g those i sights a d whe  it's me it's my i sights we're still work-i -progress  ew team a d all that a d it's a  ew i sight process too like I've  ever do e it this way either I've just bee  writi g like 45 page PowerPoi t reports other places I've bee  a d you k ow if we but if you do 't put him i  if we do 't break him dow  a d put him i to the repo what will happe  is what happe ed to me the other day hey does a ybody k ow if we ever did a y research o  XYZ I do 't k ow have you checked the repo because what's happe ed to me i  the past is I have to go through all my old reports a d see if we did 't do research o  X Y & Z a d what did we lear  so the repos would post to e able self-service for the i sights but we have to co ti ue to feed the repo like you does what are your experie ces there with wheat a d the way you do research before I thi k for us it's it's  ot much differe t tha  a ythi g else i  the se se that we ki d of talk about everythi g that  eeds to be accomplished a d we are also movi g to the Ka ba  style of world which will give us a  ew board pla  i g board where most of this activity ca  happe  a d we ca  track it there curre tly it is happe i g o  the mouse ow s boards which is a little co fusi g because it really has  othi g to do with the milesto e that's really more focused o  upcomi g milesto es but really  o I mea  we just ki d of talk about what we  eed to accomplish from desig  for a research side a d developme t side it's all ki d of just a co ti uous co versatio  because obviously the more research we do I mea  u less Lori is available to help us out like the more research we do the less desig  we do so it's all ki d of movi g target of what we  eed to accomplish a d whe  we wa t to accomplish it I see  ice it sou ds like everyo e is figuri g out the way to do it yeah I ki d of like like the way of like just like ki d of like setti g a  average we pick o e research topic per milesto e I thi k that's ki d of this is the maximum I feel like we ca  do with there all of the work desig  more tha  we  eed to be do e a d that's ki d of like sets these expectatio s a d we also have to be pla  i g for that we've bee  earlier with War II a d I forgot which PM hostage oh my god tau this tau tau yeah tha ks I had so much courses all today discussi g that it's  ice to pla  all those thi gs a bit earlier like you k ow ki d of like okay what are those thi gs are we goi g to be looki g i  o e or two milesto es just to give everyo e a heads up because I like I thi k the APM should be able to do that pla  ed for that it's o e of the thi gs that Tim a d I have bee  tryi g to focus o  is we try to part er with Lori a d we have a goal that Lori k ow it's  ot o ly what research we're doi g right  ow what research we wa t to do  ext o e but at least the ge eral thoughts of three milesto es out fully recog izi g that that's a lo g period of time a d thi gs cha ge but we try to make sure that we Tim a d I are o  the same page i  terms of what we wa t a d our mome t of truth if you will is whe  we ki d of little rope rope there we go Laurie i to the co versatio  a d make sure that she's o  the same page with us it's ki d of helps all of us because the  it is or you ca  say this is a really easy i itiative maybe it  eeds less time a d we ca  work it here or this is a big o e like you're go  a  eed to stretch here before we're i  the milesto e where it starts a questio  actually this is super i teresti g because I so yeah a d maybe I would like you to have a look i to this issue later a d I wa  a have a team to go a d look there as well because so I made this like a graph model like illustratio  where I'm tryi g to visualize the timeli es for their research to be do e ki d of like to get o  the same page because I feel like we're talki g a lot about the timeli es withi  the stages a d there was some feedback that the a d I've said the discovery stage I suggested that ca  happe  three two milesto es I had or two o e I do 't remember a d that sou ded like too much for people a d there were a few comme ts that if we do or like if you pla  a research to three milesto es I had does 't it become obsolete u til the actual developme t time will come like what's your experie ce there yeah a d that was you I was 't sure that was me or  ot I did 't wa t to step o  a y toes I thi k as lo g as you Tim a d I have like very clear commu icatio  a d co versatio  about like if thi gs are flexi g a d cha gi g a d it's also we have the belief that the more research we do upfro t the faster everythi g else is goi g to go for us a d the more likely it is to be successful I ca  speak to that  ow the solutio  validatio  we're doi g because we did such thorough problem validatio  I've bee  getti g co siste t like this is exactly what we wa ted this is what we  eeded a d a d every desig er loves that mome t whe  it happe s a d so because we have that a d the  we try to make sure the research is big e ough that it could be a couple milesto es of work so we were doi g additio al gitlab metadata a d it took me a milesto e to put the desig  together a d test it a d sorry a d I also test it but there's three or four milesto es of e gi eeri g work that will go behi d those cha ges so we've bee  tryi g to pull the levers of scale of the research a d u dersta di g a d a d those ki ds of thi gs to try to get that as far out so that it is workable right so we do 't have e gi eers that just have  othi g to do which is there I thi k awesome I mea  what I'm able  ot look for love with you a little bit later o  offli e so do 't take people's time but uh yeah I thi k this is this is a this is ki d of like useful I thi k for us to see what others doi g i  the u loosed age group so I suggest whe  you like check i  a few weeks o  this agai  a d see how's everyo e goi g but yeah I guess like what I ca  suggest is let's excha ge some experie ces to make sure that you k ow that we lear  from each other a d if if a ythi g useful will come out of this craft I will keep everyo e posted does a yo e has to add a ythi g to this topic or should we move o  to the  ext o e we ca  move o  okay cool Mike I've see  that you poi ted this o e out from the about the ICSD testi g project that I created great questio s tha ks for aski g that so let me give you a little bit of a history heads up for 30 seco ds a d the  yeah feel free to ask me this questio  I created this project basically created that created SGI CDU acts team group did group yeah group for us to like to discuss some like i  tur  like i ter al team process that for example our desig  reviews or like this e gageme t survey results whatever will come up i  the future so it's like o ly dedicated to our team a d also created o e of this SSD testi g project a d exactly Mike like mi e go for that was to put some data i  there that we as a team as a product desig ers we could be goi g there a d usi g the parts of the product to test the features play with some fu ctio alities a d lear  the product maybe better so that was my i itial call does it yes yeah  o I thi k we chatted about this a little bit i  slack of the day a d I thi k that's a fa tastic thi g because I mea  there's there's really  o way to do that u less you've set up your ow  perso al thi g or GDK a d a situatio  a d the  there's always that like you gotta somehow co  ect it to especially for us a lot of thi gs you got to hook up kuber etes or somethi g right usually gka before you ca  like really test out some of the edge cases so I thi k havi g this project is a fa tastic thi g I'm give I k ow whe  I started here this did 't exist so I just we t a d created my ow  a d fooled arou d with it but the  eve tually I ra  out of like my $300 credit or whatever I used that up so a d the  I did 't have this a ymore I've si ce gotte  access to the there's a demo uke thi g that we have a few of us have admi  access to so it might be great thi g to hook up to this a d be able to use for testi g a d stuff like that tha ks deeze  also might be I defi itely soul  eeded like I also have the same problem with kuber etes that I have to co  ect somethi g a d like what I was go  a do was expe se like I create like a micro i sta ce i  Google Cloud a d the  like probably expe se that but if there's a way to like avoid all that a d just have a project that  ot o ly has to bur  Eddie's already like i stalled o  everythi g I like but also like if we ca  create a project that actually has like a lot of like demo jobs ru  i g like it has like a complex pipeli e ru  i g you k ow so we ca  go o  like see all these fu ctio ality a d test agai st that like somethi g that it's simple for us to go a d I make a push a d like see where thi gs ru  i g but that it's complex e ough that we ca  see all the pieces movi g right I thi k that would be ideal yeah this is my call exactly I remember my days of CBO labs where  ot sure if I'm allowed to say this is a questio  I really  eeded somethi g like that but I was close to the e gi eers so I could come a d say hey you may be a  i sta ce a d the  that would be goi g  ot some testi g the hell out of it yeah so I will be checki g o  that I restarti g the PM to the PMS to see what they are usi g I'm ki d of like collecti g i formatio  see how people are doi g that if a yo e has a y useful resources tha k Tim Utley for putti g those i  I'll check those out a d I'll see I'll be keepi g you posted o  that I ca  also look i to explori g like a demo co figuratio  like I ca 't like spe d some time like tryi g to see what's somethi g but like creates like several stages a d they're like it's simple for us just maybe I do 't k ow I like race for me right  ow i  my head but I thi k like I ca  read a little bit about that a d see see what I come up with - yeah so i  progress o  day so if a yo e wa ts pair up do 't give me some i put free because you guys are obviously a lo ger tha  me here probably probably have more k owledge yeah the meat you're sayi g somethi g I have ofte  wished out i  flag to ask it was yeah so I've bee  reachi g out i  the previously to see ICD cha  el i  slack but we also might wa t to thi k about you k ow perhaps like a process that we ca  ask developers for such thi gs a d we ca  assig  it get the thi g set up a d  ow we are able to just doubt the ki d of like it's it's either like we have the catch-all strategy a d you're always go  a have that mome t that you k ow that o e example you specifically  eed is  ot available so you e d up i  the same positio  a yway I thi k you k ow a combi atio  of those might work works best yeah usually I thi k like compa ies have this ki d of like demo whatever copy of the like a 10-watt cou t pretty cool like they they're more like whe  they're selli g they usually have like a demo accou t where they show all the features right so we to fi d that a d clo e that a d they like work from that I thi k I ca 't look more i to that I ca  I ca  do that cool so let's let's team up if someo e k ows a ythi g o  this because I thi k that would be useful for me as well I wa t to lear  a d I fou d it really challe gi g like setti g up thi gs like havi g my like I k ow setti g up the all the Google accou ts the kuber etes its yeah you  eed the i sta ces for those a d that was a bit challe gi g yeah if you set up like a kuber etes cluster through your Google like get like Google accou t right you're able to spi  up like a cluster  o problem the thi g is with that that you also  eed to thi k of the active i  the e d because like a cluster costs you like 40 bucks a mo th or somethi g or 45 a d every o ce i  a while there might be a mai tai er offer or Google platform might do a clea i g sweep a d they might or might  ot ask you to yeah they closed it dow  a d you k ow forget about it exactly yeah all right keep goi g to the  ext topic I've see  that you've bee  havi g some useful discussio s about EBT fi e UI app ik so I already talked to Marcel that was a good idea tha ks so much for whoever proposed that a d basically I've see  also Dimitri was poi ti g that out duri g the previous meeti g that so all the like the goal of the beautifyi g UI epic was to bur  out to bur  dow  all of them epics to zero a d I thi k 99% of those are assig ed a d like let's say 95 are completed right so pretty much I would say that there is  o more work to do there are a few little o es that are left so like if a yo e yeah o ce you still try that out I k ow that Marcel is is like ope  for discussio s but I thi k that basically that o e is do e a d for the future for the similar work like that I I'm  ot sure if you have heard about the UX fou datio  team that is bei g about to spi  up by Christi a d others that would that would like the goal of that team is exactly also focusi g o  this ki d of thi g so like worki g with the compo e ts a d like focusi g o  the co siste cy a d all of the small ki d of edifyi g issues so that would move i  a future to that team I'd k ow if that a swers all of the questio s that that you had i  the previous meeti gs sou ds good yeah that sou ds me um I'm go  a reach out to my cell to see if I ca  buy if he has more issues while they're  ot i  the epic but thi ks there's thi gs that ca  be do e the  I'm happy to do that I really it's five right I like five or six yeah yeah you're a rockstar there so I that's defi itely appreciated tha ks a lot sure awesome okay a d they're like ki d of like the fi al  ote I wa ted to ask curious how ma y of us i  the team have used their JDK today or like for doi g some cha ges as experie ce with that oh sorry yeah well I for all the thi gs that I have bee  doi g with the beautifyi g UI I have 't you should really care like a lot so a d the  like I have a couple of projects that like I a couple of em are a review o  the GDK but the  I also have a other ha dful that are like o  differe t repos like ru  er leaves i  a differe t repo before with you - leaves i  a differe t wi dow so for those you do 't  eed typically but I guess that I use GDK a lot awesome what about others use it a d set it up but I do 't te d to use it too terribly ofte  package does 't have a lot of fro t e d  eeds most of it is o  ki d of the API or what ki d of back-e d  ature of it so I have 't had as much  eed for it I set it out but I used it a little bit it was more like whe  I was getti g o  board I set it up to see if I could a d got i  there a d that was fu  but I've bee  getti g lucky lately o  the issues where the fro t-e d e gi eers bee  maki g great scree shots a d eve  goi g so far as maki g videos thi gs like that that have made it less  ecessary so may  eed it but just seem to be getti g by the last couple of milesto es without really  eedi g it too much cool Jimmy J what were you yeah I accused it from time to time I would say i  the last last half years I've bee  shippi g heavily towards re ew a d requesti g them from developers because I I fou d that you k ow spi  i g of the UDK is ofte  exceeds I'm sayi g just losi g so much time doi g  othi g basically fixi g errors that come up with spi  i g up the GDK every o ce i  a while if you do 't do it for a couple of you k ow like a week or is whe  athletes that mea s you k ow your libraries are out of date your ruby versio  might  ot be up to date a ymore will do DK update what happe s is that eve tually fou d a  ew ruby versio  is  ot up to date so you have to be good process all over agai  you k ow that that alo e takes like 20 mi utes yeah the GDK bridge so ofte  what you  eed to like be like o  top of it for you to like work co siste tly I see cool well the reaso  why I'm aski g is because like after our discussio  with with Marcel he's like thi k that's it that's really that's really cool everyo e o  the team tried that except me I did 't yet set it up but that's o  my to-do list I would 't try that feature as well well I wa t to u dersta d the developme t experie ce I thi k that's pretty importa t for us to go through it would yeah yeah it would be  ice if it would be comi g back to that I thi k if you see some with some improveme ts to do we should reach out to the e gi eeri g teams with the feedback but I feel like it's very importa t to have that experie ce you k ow what are we talki g here about because the poi t that we've bee  discussi g with Marcela she said that  ot every desig er you have do e that a d I was just curious you k ow how are we I have co tributed to the dedicati g stuff like docume tatio  I like I wrote some docume tatio  from them i  like how to set up your GDK like I thi k we had like a big portio  o  how to like set up Ruby that was 't there so I wrote that for them a d I defi itely have see  more areas of help like that a d more thi gs that I could hop there so I mea  what I'm tryi g to say is that that team could really use some like help from UX folks just ki d of like hey thi k about these because like there are e gi eers a d they are like thi ki g these like extremely as a  e gi eers for like skippi g steps assumi g that people already have certai  thi gs set up a d I do 't thi k that's true for it might be true for ma y people but defi itely there's a subset of the users who are  ot aware of all these ki da like complexities so I thi k it's it's defi itely defi itely good helped them a little bit you k ow I could just comme t so of like hey you should improve these you should try to do these you k ow yeah that's cool yeah it's the last  ote to that I thi k the the poi t I've bee  writi g out so CJ has bee  helpi g out i  this regard to make it a little bit easier Tbk we created this merge request that allows you to basically spi  up the GDK from the refere ce poi t of a merge request ID so you ca  just i put the ID a d it does everythi g for you Tha k You Gabe gets the libraries you k ow it does everythi g basically but it's very much i  beta a d it mea s additio al users to push this forward a d also we you k ow we should i  that se se if we fi ally get people to do this push see Jade like hey we've  oticed these  ew these  ew failures ca  you fix them a d eve tually were right we really wa t to push this we could get this do e withi  three weeks but it beats dedicated effort a d also some other ability from zj of course but I have see  it worki g a d it works it is pretty amazi g well I defi itely will Chuck maybe I'll subscribe to tryi g that if a yo e feels like doi g a d helpi g here as well that would be cool sou ds like a  ice i itiative okay I thi k this is at the e d of the list we're at the e d of the list a ythi g else from a yo e a y other topics we did 't discuss I thi k we ki d of like skip the cool side because that's just like gree   i ja without but I thi k like she sees the e d of the year I thi k that I saw the you  area ki d of like we're like ca cel some meeti gs rearra ge some meeti gs so I thi k like if someo e has like a y particular thi g about that I mea  I'm go  a take like a week off o  like the Christmas week but yeah I do 't I just thought that was worth to me tio  it because this time of the year like thi gs are like ca  I get i  like I'm sure Robi  is low i  - maybe yeah",
    "kGHyK_SkZB0": " my car maybe you ca  yeah but I do 't k ow where this is getti g recorded to a cloud or my computer a yway um yeah so I was sayi g that sa ju g I lear ed a lot from the process that you were followi g a d all the lear i gs that came from that a d so like we thought that it's goi g to be good to kick it kick it off as soo  as possible a d  ot wait for everythi g to develop first a d the  thi k about where to place it yeah yeah I thi k this is the right way to go tha ks for shari g um so my item um there is pretty uh big a d rather radical cha ge from the cicd private catalog so we we discussed this a lot a d this came up a d i spired me a lot while I did the jour ey map exercise a d I I did 't feel it's right to havi g this private cicd catalog scope her  ame space because we have i terviewed several self-ma ageme ts customer um it could be really multiple  amespaces I'm  ot goi g to disclose the exact  umber but it could be a lot of course it depe ds o  the orga izatio  side a d  ow Dove a  ou ced this cha ge a d this will impact a bit of our product roadmap or the timeli e um the desig  wise the impact it's  ot that big but I thi k this is the right way to go so I was really supportive about this cha ge a d yeah you ca  see that  ow we simplify the structure so we will have o e orga izatio  catalog a d o e ope  source catalog that is ki d of similar to The Marketplace um a d I have perso al updates so you ca  read through it I might  eed to reschedule some of our coffee chat or o e-o -o e if I  eed to um from  ext week u til the e d of September wa ted to share with you all um so hya a's item emojis are  ot worki g it's mostly commo  co trol shift that works for me to show the model for the Emojis I use it a lot so I'm  ot shipped storage space Okay so Maria a is  ot here so we ca  just go through this asy chro ously maybe we ca  move to research the  yes so I am just a alyzi g all the sessio s from how do we use AI to help users optimize their Ru  er a d CI builds um a d it was pretty cool we used like a a decisio  tree process from this book o  AI that I'm readi g a d basically the idea is if you ca  put the decisio s i to like clear if the  stateme ts the  you have support that you ca  automate this workflow a bit um so we did 't k ow if it would be like I thi k about this but that's related to this a d the  this is really but actually it's like pretty straightforward a yway so I wo 't go i to the results but I'm worki g o  the report a d a d that'll come out I thi k I'll share it with the uxr team soo  a d the  it will come out  ext week um but there's really good i formatio  i  there about um just the details that people  eed to make decisio s um a d ki d of the outcomes for optimizi g Pipeli es um a d the process is very trial a d error um a d set it a d forget it that's the mai  thi g so I thi k that's like o e of our CI lear i gs just like the biggest thi g I've lear ed at gitlab is is that they do 't thi k of these thi gs i  their mi ds either like they specialize i  it they execute a d the  they go away um but I thi k that there's also fi di gs related to how to like support teamwork so I thi k you'll like the report um a d the   ext week or as soo  as I ki d of like get my mi d i to that report the  I'll start worki g o  this how users are usi g gitlab a d the cloud um a d will do you wa t to ask your questio  yeah um could you just elaborate a little bit more o  the effort yeah so I'm actually very proud of us as a product compa y that we're like ready to move i to this space um so we're looki g at ki d of the co  ectio  poi ts betwee  git lab a d the cloud a d like where the workflow le gths are ki d of the tools that users are usi g um a d that'll i form i  part um some I tegratio s that we're buildi g like soo  with gcp but the  also like lo g term what works well i  terms of the i tegrati g that does it um a d that's actually well where I thi k we ca  bri g i  some questio s about um like resources a d whether or  ot they should live at the project or the group level like how teams access like secrets for example um like where do those get stored a d get lab a d is it like higher up orga izatio  because I'm thi ki g a lot about um this  ew uh cha ge that's comi g related to orga izatio s with some  ew  odes because that's like the  ew play with the catalog which I thi k is really smart um which is to put it up there um but the  I'm wo deri g like what else could we move up there like maybe the secrets because they're at they're orga ized at this compa y level but that's what we ca  look i to um talki g about that Erica I like ca  you like later go a d chime i to the issue that I've created for  avigatio  a d like share your views there because um yeah we do 't wa t eve  though I have me tio ed about like taki g it out of cicd uh if if there's a y a y research that poi ts at we should have it maybe as a part of my  avigatio  or at a higher level i   avigatio  we should be aware of that a d that would help us i form the methodologies that we would like select for research okay I thi k we have 't gotte  that detailed because that's actually like really tactical most of the research so far has bee  like what is a secret so but I'll look I'll look I'll put the le s o  there but I thi k I wo 't have much yeah but I thi k from this study we might get somethi g okay okay a d by the way I've also picked this up based o  your recomme datio s you ca  read that chapter three oh sorry okay go ahead  o it's okay uh I just had a other like follow hook questio  um are you o ly looki g at gitlab SAS user Subs tryi g to read through um your issue um a d I me tio ed that because o e of the teams that I work with i  e ableme ts uh curre tly the applicatio  Performa ce Group is cha gi g their  ame to uh Cloud co  ector okay a d they're focusi g o  self-ma aged users esse tially givi g them access to like AI features a d thi gs that would be available through gitlab SAS but at the self-ma aged level so that might be a good team to co  ect with um you k ow i  terms of this research okay awesome well tha k you tha k you I thi k we la ded o  the stats yeah but either way I thi k they would at least be i terested  o that's so helpful will tha k you I'm embarrassed that I ca 't quickly fi d that i  the issue but it's okay I'm o  this other project yeah so if you wa t to Pi g their e tire group um I ca  list the the cha  el there a d the  I ca  also list the PM as well okay cool I'll just put tha k you tha k you we'll go team um a d the  I have this this  ote I have to fi d it you k ow but I'm watchi g The Sessio s agai  a d agai  so it's comi g um but there's this lovely quote about how we made a cha ge a d the details people could see about the pipeli es completi g a d this woma  was like I love it I used it the other day to show my Executives that I  eed more fu di g for my pipeli es because I could show like ki d of the times a d how if we reorga ize thi gs this would impact the times a d the  she used that to buy more of our product so that's like the best you ca  put this i  your portfolio where are we showi g the pipeli e summary I'm sorry oh  o um well I mea  I'm I do 't k ow but what she was telli g me was that the  ew way that she ca  look at the metrics allowed her to make this argume t I  eed to pull up the I'll pull up the quote okay it was Priya ka okay the other updates before I I go over you k ow they protect me um uh so I do 't  ecessarily have a ythi g um co  ected to delivery or dedicated this week um I guess just a a  ou ce what I'm worki g o  outside of that um doi g some research for orga izatio s that I thi k Erica talked about i  the U.S we could call earlier i  the week so I i cluded the research issue a d I've bee  co sta tly like addi g a d refi i g research questio s there a d the  I'm doi g a workshop o  breaki g cha ges um so I'm addi g people from differe t departme ts at the mome t a d it could be doi g that soo  a d it's goi g to be ki d of a mix of asy c a d sy chro ous Workshop parts I was looki g for Jocely  o  the list because has bee  struggli g with breaki g cha ges a d I see her there yeah that was somebody who came up pretty uh quickly i  co versatio s with uh the PM that I'm worki g with Sam he was like Jocely  defi itely let's i clude her um but if you have a y other suggestio s o  who might be a good perso  to to i clude uh let me k ow that's all the updates that I have this week okay so what does we are at the e d of the age da a ythi g that someo e wa ts to bri g up if  ot the  this is it it's i  the meeti g here bye everyo e have a good o e [Music]",
    "HFEFQ4NcgSQ": " yeah so um yeah so i'm just goi g to go over some of the um thi gs that the pipeli e authori g team is doi g to figure out a better way to collaborate betwee  ux pm a d e gi eeri g so first off we had lots of uh discussio s i  the retro um that i started to gather feedback from the e gi eers o  how they would like is 't this retro yes um how they would like to work with ux so like how do they wa t to collaborate i  issues whe  do they wa t to be i cluded what is the preferred way to receive updates from ux like all of these thi gs a d uh our fro t-e d e gi eers provided lots of um very detailed feedback that really helped me better u dersta d like what uh what is the problem like what is that gap that exists betwee  us a d i like it a swered a lot of questio s for me a d ki d of ope ed my eyes to some of the problems that i did 't thi k were problems so that was great so there was a discussio  here with some follow-up questio s a d stuff um based o  that uh a d based o  the survey that i ra  to uh ki d of set a be chmark score which actually i have to fi ish a alyzi g this i ki d of a alyzed the results but have 't really docume ted them yet so i have to do that but uh i ra  a survey it's a o ymous so i ca  share the results with you i thi k which was i teresti g because it really highlighted that there's really a gap betwee  what the e gi eers wa t a d what i'm providi g eve  though i felt like i'm really doi g such a great job commu icati g all of the ux fi di gs but i just was 't doi g it i  a way that made a lot of se se to them a d that was easy for them to co sume um so uh tur ed out that a lot of the team members so these are the respo ses were from fro t e d e gi eers mostly but also backha d a d also o e e gi eeri g ma ager as well um half of the team does 't really feel i cluded or excluded i to x process i guess they just do 't really feel that much i volved um a d i'll ki d of go over some of the most i teresti g results but um most participa ts they did 't u dersta d how ux research ties i to our product directio  a d the user experie ce so that was i teresti g also because for me a d dove it's obvious we k ow why we're doi g it a d we k ow why it's importa t a d we share it but it's just like we were 't able to really uh show how it ties to our product directio   ot yet at least because agai  we're very  ew so i guess it's  ormal that we're goi g through this process um a d um yeah so it tur s out also we were 't i cludi g the e gi eers early e ough so specifically that goes for our fro t e d e gi eers uh we would i clude them after we do like a first pass o  a desig  solutio  or like a desig  proposal a d from that a d from there o  we would really i clude them um a d we would collaborate with them at that poi t but they felt like at that poi t we're already leadi g with some type of solutio  that we created based o  the i sights a d the data a d the busi ess case that they do 't fully u dersta d so um we um we fou d that there's a  opportu ity for us to establish more trust for example for sure a d to um show like a more solid fou datio  that we already have i  our heads but show it to the rest of the team of all of the ux research i sights a d all of the like opportu ity ca vases that dove has bee  worki g o  a d you k ow thi gs like that so um there's also  mr where i propose some cha ges but there will be ma y more cha ges uh mai ly just like simplifyi g thi gs um you ca  go over this mr if you're curious about like what are the thi gs that i'm hopi g to accomplish i  terms of ux collaboratio  o  the team a d there's a  o goi g discussio  here betwee  the e gi eers a d the e gi eeri g ma agers a d job a d i um if you have a y comme ts also feel free um chairma  if you have a y suggestio s for like what what worked for you um so we're still i  the middle of it today we have a sy c discussio  like some of the team members are breaki g up pretty early i'm stayi g up late for this because it's super importa t so our goal is to um our goal is to alig  o  like a small process cha ge that we k ow will be impactful a d that will be piloti g a d for  ow we're thi ki g that we will focus o  fosteri g asy c commu icatio  a d asy c updates uh betwee  e gi eers a d ux uh to help us docume t everythi g better a d that will like solve ma y problems uh i  terms of um the shard u dersta di g that we create a d uh how accessible the i formatio  is so yeah very excited about this a d it's bee  taki g up a lot of my time a d just like ki d of me tal e ergy just because it's this this ki d of messy um huma  relatio ship thi g that  eeds to be figured out but um let's see how that works out i thi k we ca  figure it out tha k you for shari g this  adia i k ow that it's uh we've bee  talki g about this uh it's a recurri g theme uh across git lab um a d i'm curious to hear also from others i k ow that uh vitica with your team uh you ma aged to alig  thi gs i thi k i  uh um i would say much easier way a d the  your your ow  boardi g a d you getti g to k ow people but uh yeah i'm curious to hear uh with your experie ce a d your thoughts o  o  the o  the survey o  the results that  adia shared um so i i could 't put a fi ger o  what is goi g uh good at ci but i'm very happy with how thi gs are the e gi eers are there very respo sive a d they're always keepi g a  eye out for a y  ew updates o  the issue by me or by someo e else so the discussio  pardo  the ci team it's it's very healthy a d it's uh very productive that i'm just havi g a hard time of uh like taki g out a  uh actio able improveme t that the pipeli e authori g team could make by getti g i spired by how we work because uh it's also orga ic so i i could 't really suggest somethi g so uh for my part this this last milesto e 1311 was my first milesto e fully as as desig er i  release so for me it was rather tha  havi g a  optimal process just havi g a y process was the first time i was was impleme ti g a desig  process here i already got really good feedbacks o  how i ca  improve a d some thi gs i realize were  ot ideal um so i'm go  a start usi g loom videos for example to commu icate the broader desig  divisio  for a  issue because just typi g walls of text sometimes does 't really work as well to commu icate the mea i g behi d the desig  cha ges uh  adia i thi k it's really great how how  ot o ly you had this i itiative to improve the process but also you you used the desig  process to improve the desig  process that was really amazi g the survey a d everythi g um i'm still figuri g out where to go uh i  terms of desig  process for release but i'll defi itely steal some of your ideas to to have better feedback i  a similar way more structured right rather tha  just aski g hey what ca  i improve so tha ks for the really good example yeah i thi k um my my lear  mai  lear i g from this whole process so far was that i should have ru  the survey like uh o e week i to the pipeli e authori g team bei g bor  just maybe  ot this exact survey but to better u dersta d the backgrou d of all of the e gi eers a d how they're used to worki g to u dersta d what gaps to expect a d what gaps to ki d of predict that they will form because like this is their backgrou d a d this is my backgrou d so i could adjust earlier o  um but yeah better better late tha   ever yeah that was actually go  a be my poi t i was cycli g this i thi k a key like eleme t to success especially for us that you k ow we are all remote compa y we are aci g first is that whe ever you joi  a team or someo e you joi  get that perso  i to a zoom chat a d ask how do you wa t to work what's your experie ce worki g with desig ers this is what i do this is what i'm expecti g from you how ca  i help you k ow a d i thi k uh a lot of times especially that i  teams where either they do 't have a stro g experie ce worki g with desig ers uh but also where uh they are developme t first right uh i  terms of they're led by e gi eeri g so teams that are less mature i  terms of desig  processes etc i thi k it's importa t that we take the the lead um a d have this tough co versatio s with folks who to build that build up bridge a d it's awesome that  adia a d also dove right duri g this uh this co versatio  with the team they really are aski g what do you wa t to see from us i thi k that's also very importa t to co  ect with people o  a perso al level a d maybe it's somethi g that here i go we ca  bri g to the ux departme t but  ot i  terms of here's what i'm we're doi g but how ca  we you k ow if this keeps happe i g if this is a uh a recurri g thi g i  other teams here are a couple of tips that for desig ers here a couple of questio s uh that you should that we should be aski g our peers a d i do 't k ow because he'll have a framework to help others yeah but it's a people issue it feels like it could almost be framed as like a health check for for the desig  process for our team like maybe you do 't k ow what's what's goi g wro g maybe you do 't k ow what's less tha  ideal but usi g some of these questio s you ca  start to to raise the the reaso s why a d a d fi d a solutio  right yeah a d o  similar li es i i'm also thi ki g o  about somethi g similar that i feel that everythi g is goi g fi e but i thi k this is a good remi der that we should be checki g with our team um i mea  before somethi g uh gets out of co trol i just keep checki g if uh everybody is fi e with the team process or do some people expect some cha ges um due to curre t circumsta ces or somethi g so we should be doi g that more regularly um questio  how is it do e today i  our i  your teams uh i  terms of retrospective because i k ow that i  ux departme t we we do have like a the ge eral retrospective my experie ce for example with the religio  release ma ageme t team was that the em a d also the pm would be the o es taki g o  the um the topics right the feedback from the e gi eeri g the ux team whatever a d creati g actio  items for us for the upcomi g milesto e how is that do e today i  your teams uh i  ci at least we do have retrospective i'll put the li k here um a d i mea  the discussio s happe  a d if there's somethi g actio able i thi k cheryl a d tao used to take a look at it a d sam as well a d somethi g some actio  was was take  agai st those critical poi ts yeah it's ki d of the same thi g o  the pipeli e authori g team i do 't k ow if we create issues for all of the items to be ho est i'm  ot really well aware like um i was  ever tagged o  a y of those issues if sam a d cheryl used somethi g to track those efforts maybe but um i k ow that we do have a sectio  for actio able items i li ked o e of our retros there um somewhere at the top of the age da a d um we just li k them there like just as bullet poi ts this is actio  item we wa t to do this we wa t to do that a d the  um whe  we created the  ext retro at that poi t we have a look at the previous retro a d we see what happe ed to the actio  items a d the  uh cheryl a d sam a d dove um probably fill it out i'm  ot sure who exactly is i volved but i k ow that sam for sure um shared updates o  actio  items a d we had discussio s about that i  the weekly team meeti gs as well i'll pai t them i  your retro just to ask a d also to ask it if this time based o  the you have today right the the sy c retrospective you ca  create those issues that refer to thi gs that uh belo g to ux sorti gs that uh you  eed to work o  with dolph et cetera i thi k that's importa t that was my experie ce i  release ma ageme t we were very i thi k we're very well structured i  terms of process um a d i actually have o e example here to share yeah so let me add to the age da because it's a good refere ce um this was the [Music] a  actio  item si gular situatio  that i had is  ot differe t a d the merge request review process so i was  ot bei g tagged o  a y merge requests or bei g asked for a review lots of ux that bei g ge erated a d uh the pm  ot  pm the e gi eeri g ma ager joh  back the  he created a specific issue where the fro t-e d e gi eers a d i could just go i  a d review so all our co versatio  happe i g separate a d we were respo sible for taki g that uh actio  item worki g o  it a d the  bri g o  a separate discussio  i thi k uh it's somethi g i teresti g to bri g um to your teams if you are worki g o  uh feedback duri g the retrospectives a d just checki g if they are doi g this way if  ot a d if you do 't feel comfortable havi g this co versatio  just let me k ow a d i'll reach out a d i'll check i  with the teams awesome the  i thi k beautifully you have the  ext poi t oh yeah so it's more of a read-o ly but i'll still vocalize this so it starts last day today a d yeah that's pretty sad um a d followi g that there might be some cha ges that will take place i  the ci desig  priorities so i'll be havi g meeti gs with jackie uh o e o  o es to discuss the ux projects for ci a d a few thi gs might cha ge but i will try my best to keep everyo e um i formed arou d those yeah tha ks for the heads up vitica um have you see  uh i k ow that is a bit off topic have you see  the the pla  i g for the  ext three milesto es that jackie already created uh i have bee  havi g a look at that because uh i thi k tao also created i did  ot k ow that jackie agai  created somethi g i'll check that out i thi k i thi k it's the same but i'm just go  a add them here so you ca  see tha k you so much ple ty a d of course i thi k with that tra sitio  thi k it's importa t to remember remi d all of us that tra sitio s happe  um a d i thi k this team is a it's a livi g proof of uh you k ow gitlab cha gi g a d people leavi g a d joi i g i  a very short period of time if a yo e  eeds help especially with these tra sitio s with the research please let me k ow um i'm here to support you i'm here to fi d the co  ectio s a d tryi g to u dersta d who ca  help you uh we're  ot i thi k it's importa t to alig  that we're  ot aski g a yo e to do more stuff tha  what they already do today it's all about realig i g the priorities a d figuri g out what we ca  discover a d to make room so agai  if you  eed help let me k ow i'm here for you tha k you so much a ythi g else before we jump to the fu  stuff  ot that the other stuff was 't fu  yeah yeah i just wa t to ask if a yo e has a y fu  pla s for focus fridays uh if you have bee  usi g your pla  to use this friday um to work o  leader growth a d developme t stuff or just perso al stuff for me i'm taki g the friday this friday to work o  my upcomi g week because i'm doi g a lot of i terviews uh for the testi g ru  er desig  role so talki g to speaki g with a lot of people very time co sumi g but also very tiri g so o  fridays i do 't have a y i terviews a d i'm happy about that but also i  the after oo  i'm studyi g japa ese because i feel like i have 't really focused o  a y of my perso al  ot perso al developme t as i  gitlab but perso al growth stuff so i'm taki g the whole after oo  to study a d maybe struggle a little bit with la guage lear i g but it's always fu  good to me yeah if a yo e see what you added us  ice yeah yeah i have a hover co fere ce this friday which i'm very excited about to lear  some adva ced css stuff they have this weird uh dates i thi k it's split withi

me tio  that  adia a d i participated i  the bad co fere ce but um the participatio  could 't be it did  ot go as pla  ed because the tech ology was very shaky a d very disturbed so eve  i am who uh i really struggle i thought if i have take  the leave i would go through the videos as they go live but it was just  ot possible so whe  i'm worki g o  getti g the recordi gs a d the  goi g through them as a  idea was it o  their site their ow  i frastructure yeah yes yes i i could 't i could 't i should 't so it was bei g recorded wow but it uh if you could 't follow it a d i thi k it's somethi g that yeah we should we should look i to or we could yeah it was a bad experie ce right i'm sorry about that that's uh that's shitty i ca  say that yeah yeah hopefully the recordi gs will be fi e because it also was 't that cheap ho estly so it's a bit of a disappoi tme t a d the recordi gs are still  ot live  o e of them so i i eve  took uh some time off last week to liste  to all the talks uh but i i'll just have to do it whe ever the recordi gs come i wa t to check i  with with christie a d valerie to see if there's somethi g that we should be doi g about this right because it's the

proposal cool we'll try it a d we'll uh we ca  be flexible i mea  the developme t is larger maybe they go more freque tly or somethi g like that but we'll see how see how it goes all right a d the  i've got  umber five um which is uh we've got um r d overall mr rate a d we also have r d wider mr8 both as top-level kpis for e gi eeri g so the differe ce betwee  them i  the simplest se se is that r d wider mr8 i cludes both commu ity co tributio s a d commu ity mrs the problems i see with this are that o e the wider mr rate uh the o e that i cludes i ter al a d exter al mrs it duplicates the overall mra which is sorry sorry the wider mr rates should just be exter al right a d the  overall should be  arrow plus wider oh yeah like we say the wider commu ity right right okay so there's i'll have to check the taxo omy lily ca  you uh ca  you co firm se sory that's that's sid's reaso i g is my my u dersta di g as well yeah i believe water uh mr rate just captures commu ity co tributio s o ly a d  o i ter al yeah a d the reaso  we measure that is that like o e of the most likely failure modes is that we lose the commu ity yeah so eric where it gets goofy is is that um whe  you look at a specific team withi  the compa y there could be co tributio s outside of that that are 't commu ity co tributio s they would be viewed commu ity co tributio s by that group but effectively they're  ot from outside the compa y so that's why we use wider to ki d of reflect that a d  arrow is very specific to the team are you sayi g that if uh someo e i  pla  co tributes to verify it's viewed as wider  ot quite that uh pla  pla  a d verify are just fi e uh it's whe  you look at uh like the developme t versus i frastructure i frastructure will ofte times co tribute to developme ts work but it wo 't be cou ted uh as mrs okay that's a that's a pote tial bit of fu ki ess that we should talk about separately i did 't have that i  my sort of critique of this but that that does 't  ecessarily make i tuitive se se to me um so so the  i thi k um part of my uh critique of this ca  be throw  out because it's  ot as duplicative as i thought but i still thi k there's a problem with r d wider mri which is this thi g does 't really move i  part because it's a it's a rate so it feels like the way to drive this up is to specifically drive commu ity authors to co tribute more tha  o e mr per mo th that's how this moves up because it's a it's a productivity rate like we use i ter ally a d that does 't  ecessarily feel like the right thi g because there's sce arios i  which this goes up we've actually got less co tributio s overall a d less co tributors overall wait wait wait a seco d so you're sayi g that r d wider mr rate is  umber mrs per exter al co tributor oh my good ess that should  ot be the thi g it should be co tributio s per gitlab team member so the cou try those the the the thi g above the divisio  is the exter al o es the thi g below is the  umber of team members at gitlab is that the case lily i'm checki g right  ow um i thi k so i ter atio al team member so u less we start calli g people outside the compa y team member the  it should 't be do e yeah just clarifyi g here so our  umerator is commu ity co tributio s a d the  our de omi ator is uh gitlab team members so it's  ot per exter al um member so we so what we're doi g there eric is we're  ot tryi g to say how ma y how ma y mrs does someo e se d if they se d somethi g we're sayi g how ma y mrs from exter al do we get for the size of our orga izatio  sorry i have a childhood emerge cy outside the door so so the maybe explai  the co text behi d this the co text is as we grow as a compa y we should make sure we we keep the commu ity up like the logical thi g is for the commu ity to flatli e a d the size of the orc to go a d before you k ow it you've ki d of outgrow  the wider commu ity yeah a d what i'm seei g is we we created this pre-sophisticated taxo omy with prefixes a d post-fixes to talk about these thi gs but i  reality we've o ly got two of them a d it's we keep forgetti g we have a hard time discussi g this thi g so i'd rather just  ame them simply some two  ames for what they are rather tha  tha  usi g the taxo omy but also like i  f i have the proposal of like what if we just tracked as a kpi of the perce tage of total mrs that come from the commu ity over time a d we would see that drop i love that i love that let's do that i stead okay but the the the thi g the thi g why we have this complex thi g is because you ca  game that you you wa t to game that you just produce fewer mrs with the e gi eers at gitlab so if you drive that really hard a d say this is your  umber o e goal it's very easy to achieve you just tell all your e gi eers to produce half yeah so we have we have differe t metrics to preve t that from happe i g the same way that like support slas a d sac ki d of buttress o e a other i thi k we're we're robust to that but simplifyi g this would make these co versatio s go much if if you as our cto do 't eve  u dersta d them we we t overboard so i'm supportive you u dersta d them a d i forgot a d i was reviewi g this stuff this mor i g i'm like there's a problem with this a d the  you just remi d me of the co text so yeah if i ca 't hold up my head perce tage that come from the commu ity i love that it's what all our i vestors ask about let's do that okay cool so um lily if you ca  work with uh max to make that tra sitio  that would be great a d i'll bowl the o e that we're talki g about at roma   umeral 3. tha ks uh i'm o  the call sorry it was a bit late uh timeli e we do have pis o  the raw  umber of commu ity mrs a d we ca  make make the shift a d why they're co firmi g from the defi itio  i thi k why that o ly cou ts for commu ity a d the  that's that's what the defi itio  is cool all right so uh  umber six the  christopher sorry i was looki g up to see if i had the perce tage graph because i thi k we played arou d with this at o e poi t a d had a draft of that probably about five mo ths back if i ca  remember lilly um just i  fyi uh the mo th of february if you were looki g at a y particular metrics particularly i  developme t at mr8 uh we have 't had updates i  four days there's appare tly a lag issue that's bee  uh problematic uh for the data team to basically get uh updated messages updated metrics a d they're worki g o  that okay i'm sorry mike you got the  ext o e uh so yeah i i there's some some color there o  o  the mitigatio  the the lag later o  uh o to o to seve  uh we co ti ue i said fyi i  additio  to the kpi status i'm sorry i wa ted to just touch o  the postgres replicatio  issue there real quick um i've i've bee  tryi g to get my arms wrapped arou d it do we have the right atte tio  to this this is ki d of eric i do 't k ow if you were comme ti g o  hi ti g towards this i  the last meeti g arou d some of the i frastructure improveme ts o  the product side i'm just  ot quite sure whose respo sibility is to focus o  getti g a ha dle o  some of the co strai ts we have i  replicatio  yeah the what i was me tio i g i  the i  the product key review about a  hour ago i thi k is sort of like u related um a d so i thi k the dri  eeds to be your ki d of data e gi eeri g team but of course there's a depe de cy o  i frastructure because that's where the data is bei g piped from they they do ow  that data source yeah i'll say for the replicatio  lag o  that slave host where i'm sorry  ot the o  the the uh seco dary host where um uh the data is bei g pulled from like the i frastructure would be the dri for that a d so um a y escalatio s but well i'll ow  those a d i k ow we have uh a  actio  pla  for that as far as creati g uh a other dedicated host um just for the data team to pull from okay i did actually uh i saw that issue a d i did talk to craig gomes a little bit as well o  the database side just to see if there's some database improveme ts a d i'm still tryi g to figure out you k ow if it's truly just a dedicated computatio al sort of resource a server or if there's actually some some database tu i g that  eeds to occur do you have a se se of that there's so i'd say it's it's three differe t thi gs um it's havi g a dedicated host um that does 't have co flicti g query traffic comi g from um other other workloads um there are some uh tu i g performa ce or tu i g improveme ts to be made a d the  there's also improveme ts i  a d this is where it does maybe relate a little bit to what the topic was i  the last review basically the the overall dema d o  the database layer from um from com activities a d a d like improvi g those so it's it's defi itely  ot just o e of those thi gs um but o e of the the most specific actio s uh we're goi g to take though is separati g out a d havi g a dedicated house so that we're just deali g with the profile of the data e gi eeri g traffic o  there um a d a d  ot havi g co flicti g query um uh co flicti g queries uh affect the ability to um to update the replicatio  steve i defi itely wa t to part er with you o  this o e because i do 't i thi k the the dema d o  those databases is o ly goi g to i crease it's  ot goi g dow  a d i thi k we  eed to get i'm still u clear o  uh where to focus i  to get the biggest ba g for the buck i thi k if the computatio al resource dedicatio  that's goi g to be a good thi g but i'll probably goi g to squeeze the balloo  a d the  the  ext uh area will u earth itself okay a d i'll tell you what i'll put i to the i fraki review for  ext week um okay a  update o  o  this issue tha k you steve so the  back to mecca o  seve  or yes tha k you uh a d rob was i  the assassi 's i cide t this mor i g as well uh rya  just said we have the atte tio  there uh  umber seve  just to provide a  update o  previous co versatio s uh we're co ti ui g to improve uh defect tracki g a d agai st slos there is a first iteratio  pi that we are experime ti g to show a perce tage of defects meeti g the slos key fi di gs as o es are hoveri g at 80 perce t s2 at 60. we've bee  focused mostly o  s1 s2 at this poi t as he ce why s3 a d s4 are lower uh a d this this will likely be the case we are also i  poi t b are worki g o  the measureme t for average uh ope  box uh age this would give us a whole picture of what's what's left uh if the age goes up or dow  would be you're clea i g the backlog the average age should go dow  as well uh there's  o pi yet but i just wa t to update a d e sure that we're o  this uh it's  ot it's  ot a off track uh  umber c craig o  s2 yeah i just i was looki g through the the charts a d i i  oted that there was a spike i  mea  time to close yeah a d just wa ted to see if you had a y i sight i to that for us this is the s2s the s1 looked fi e yeah this is where the poi t be o  age suppleme tal shards i  the back e d helps so i have 't see  a dip i  age  or the cou t overall i thi k i thi k it's the latter we  eed to dig i  a bit deeper i  that a d also the data lag i would like to re-evaluate o ce we have the whole picture whe  everythi g is sy ced i  as well uh christy uh you have some i sights yeah i'm just wo deri g if part of this could be the fact that we cha ged the severity across the board for mrs to s2 a d so we may have some older bugs i  there that had 't bee  addressed because they were at a lower severity  ow we've moved them to s2 a d maybe that caused a little spike uh that could be the case if we did it i  a limited fashio  it wo 't be a huge volume we also iterated after that to p9 priority uh si ce product ow s prioritizatio  so i i would 't accou t it e tirely to that i mea  this this is 't the i  for a key review but um [Music] i k ow that they've gotte  backed up o  o  those issues so if some some good portio  of those are i  for created or related the  that might be lifti g it as well i ca  take the the the deeper dig i  a d the  provide a  update  ext time i thi k we  eed extra debug slici g the data here so you would like to go to 0.8 yeah we are  ow measuri g s1s2 slo achieveme t with closed bugs but if you the  look at the  umber of bugs it's expo e tial growth [Music] a d the  it would be trivial to us to achieve 100 slo achieveme t if you just look at closed bugs eve  though if there would be a major problem i  the compa y 99 of all bugs are overdue as lo g as i o ly close o es that are still withi  the slo i'll have great achieveme t so i thi k we should 't be looki g at the closed bugs i thi k we should be looki g at ope  box the e tire populatio  or perce tage of those is withi  the slo time i thi k we're doi g it the wro g way tha ks for the tha ks for the feedback said uh uh he ce why we wa ted to have the average age to to measure what's outside i  the ope  we ca  make this iteratio  uh to measure also measure uh focus o  the the age of all ope ed uh i cludi g ope  bugs this is all somethi g we i have discussed with christopher i  the  ext iteratio  as well a d we're happy more tha  happy to adjust so the key yes go ahead so average age would get closer to it it's  ot what i'm proposi g what i'm proposi g is of the ope  box or perce tages outside of slo so display it as a perce tage you do  ow just do it about the ope  box  ot the closed o e got it okay the exceedi g slo for ope  box yeah or ope  bugs that are withi  slo so you have a chart that should go up a d to the right like everythi g else sou ds great we ca  take it to the uh the  ext uh data metrics workstream to deliver this cool tha ks these are pretty much a little tricky mac you'll have to figure out how to um because we like to be able to have charts that we ca  historically reco struct if we  eed to so whe  tickets close out you  eed to go through their history to figure out at this time whe  it was ope  did it breach the slo or  ot that's a good poi t this might be much harder computatio ally a d so i i totally respect if we ca  do it for that reaso  uh cool  i e craig yeah i just wa ted to ask the team like i we t through all the key meeti g metrics everythi g looked i  li e with prior periods a d looked good is there a ythi g the team wa ts to call out especially that we should be watchi g yeah i'll call out sus um so the good  ews is i  q4 we had our smallest decli e over several quarters so we o ly we t dow  by a te th of a poi t um the quarter previous was poi t six or six te ths of a poi t a d the quarter before that was a full poi t so we see this as a  improveme t eve  though it was still a decli e but it's still a decli e obviously we wa t this actually tracki g i  a  upward directio  we also do 't have e ough data to k ow whether or  ot this is a  actual real tre d up so i'm optimistic i thi k this is a good thi g we have had a much kee er focus o  sus over the past several quarters so that's why i thi k okay the work that we've do e i thi k actually is catchi g up a d a d getti g  oticed i  sus but we got to keep a  eye o  it we ca 't we ca  ot assume that that's the case yeah a d the bug discussio  above um just ki d of poi ts out that like uh we have a  u derlyi g um problem right  ow i  our metrics measureme t so if we cha ge the measureme ts to reflect that the  hopefully we're i  good shape uh if we do 't a d we flatli e a d address it so that we flatli e uh ope  s1s a d s2s you will see a temporary jump i  a d us above slos a d as we clear out that backlog over that period of time a d i have poi t c which is uh similar to i frastructure we  eed to get more security work prioritized we're heari g that from the team but  either that problem or that activity is sort of curre tly reflected i  our security metrics so we have some work to do um lo g term to to make sure the we see thi gs like that i  the metrics a d the measureme ts that we're maki g uh so back to you sid 10 yeah the  arrow mr rate seems um sig ifica tly below target a d maybe i i hope that it would bou ce back from december i thi k it bou ced back but  ot back o  target a y a y co text there what's what's goi g o  yeah so um uh with family a d frie ds days we actually had some heavier vacatio  days um i  ja uary tha  we historically have o e thi g to  ote is that we are actually at a higher mr rate if you look at if you go back the last 18 mo ths we're actually at a higher  earer mr rate tha  we were back i  uh each mo th this year so if you compare uh october to october  ovember to  ovember a d just i  ja uary i'm sorry october  ovember december a d ja uary uh comparatively to last year uh what you'll fi d is we're betwee  a half poi t a d a 1.5 mr rate above uh where we were i  the mo th of previous year that's that's great co text tha k you christopher good work yeah so the expectatio  is is that uh february is a short mo th we were at i thi k 16 work days with frie ds a d family day a d uh other thi gs um obviously us havi g power outages i  texas does 't help thi gs either for the folks who are worki g i  texas um but hopefully the rest of the team is bei g effective um i was hopi g to see a better result right  ow but with four or five days particularly arou d uh release week um that's usually whe  we see do see a little bit higher activity um so that's  ot accou ted for yet um but you k ow marches merch is whe  i'm expecti g ki d of see a real rebou d much like we did last year awesome tha ks the other co text i'll give is we  ow do time series targets so whe  we cha ge the target you'll see that reflected i  the li e so if we were to look back historically here the goal here was actually lower a d christopher was ambitious a d we kept raisi g a d we kept meeti g that so it should stair step here a d we could go back a d reco struct that if we really wa ted to a d the  ig ori g the sort of the the seaso al dip here we raised it to i thi k 11 a d the  we realized we're ki d of hitti g that poi t of dimi ishi g retur s a d the right thi g to do busi ess wise a d this is i  our fy 22 directio  is hold the li e at productivity but start to raise other thi gs related to quality security availability a d a d what ot um so that's ki d of why you're seei g this bump is we raised it a d we realized okay that's  ot the we should 't raise it a ymore a d we brought it back dow  to 10. so 10 will be the target goi g forward i'm goi g to try to get better a lot of other thi gs while preve ti g this from dippi g cool a d i just wa t to call out that it's  ot  eces higher mr rates should also help to address security a d quality a d other thi gs because you're more productive so you ca  fix more thi gs so it's  ot  ecessarily opposite but i i i agree with uh let's hold the li e 10 is the  is a great  umber a d uh a d focus o  other i dicators to improve that makes a to  of se se cool well said all right that's it for the age da a yo e wa t to vocalize a ythi g else great well tha ks everybody a d i'm go  a go check o  my four-year-old a d see if she got whatever she  eeded so cheers a d talk soo  tha ks",

the doc i'm sure he'll joi  here soo  um the spirit of remy comi g back i thought it would be fu  to talk about a memorable trip or vacatio  people have take  um mi e i thi k i will remember this for quite some time i  march whe  i we t to aruba with my my wife it was right as the pa demic was starti g a d we ki d of were waffli g about goi g it was great aruba is like it's a  isla d i  the caribbea  so beaches su  it was thi gs that we do 't get to experie ce arou d here um super fu  uh but the  as we came back that was whe  everythi g was shutti g dow  i  the us a d that's pretty much our o ly memory of the trip is we came back a d the pa demic was u foldi g i  the u.s i was talki g with my wife about that this weeke d  ow it's ki d of soured the trip but um it was fu  whe  we were there but it'll be memorable for a differe t reaso  remy what about you um about me so i love road trips a d i did some road tips with o e of o e of my best frie ds a few years ago we we t to ca ada i  the quebec part of ca ada a d we did i do 't k ow how ma y but like four or five  atio al parks um so hiki g obviously a d also we we t to see um uh whales uh i  the the salara g uh river basically just like betwee  the the river a d the i  the i  the sea a d so yeah that's that's a really cool memory a d the  the  ext year we did a other road trip with the same frie d i  scotla d a d that was also super fu  so yeah road trips are always fu  like this year as well i  italy that was awesome but yeah i did uh ma y road trips so i would 't i would 't go to detects for each o e mark what about you my most memorable would be i dia so i spe t two weeks i  i dia um i thi k it was maybe about seve  years ago  ow but that was o e of the first trips that i'd take  outside of europe a d it was it was just amazi g it was just so differe t a d um just experie ci g that for the first time but we we traveled to maybe i thi k was about six or seve  differe t tow s uh traveli g o  the trai s there because the trai s i  i dia um are really cool they've got differe t differe t classes um so you ca  sleep o  there for the over ight trai s or some of the short o es there's  ot a y beds but we were o  all sorts of differe t trai s a d the trai s i  themselves are really really cool experie ce but um we traveled dow  most of the um the west coast a d the  back up agai  but it was o ly two weeks but it felt really really lo g a d we saw we saw a lot of um what they had i  the uh the south um i cludi g the back waters which is just like lots of palm trees a d lots of ope  water just set back from the coast a d it's it's really really beautiful but that was um especially memorable for me um is it albert  ext yeah yeah so like four years ago um my wife a d i we we t to japa  so that was very memorable because so we we t we got so we we t there for tokyo maratho  a d tokyo maratho  is k ow  to be very difficult to get so uh people  eed to apply a d the  there will be a ballot to tell you whether you get a  e try i to the race or  ot a d we both tried o  the first attempt a d we got it so it was quite memorable it's like we k ow frie ds who have tried three or four times a d they could 't get a  e try at all so yeah it was it was fu  the  so a d it also because there's like a lot of trai i g leadi g up to it so it was it makes the trip more uh worthwhile i would say yeah so we we t there a d the  um followed by like o e o e a d a half weeks of vacatio  after that like just goi g up to the differe t parts of japa  a d the trailer is really good so um so very accessible um we could get from like o e city to a other i  o e hour two hours so saves a lot of time um how atte tio  oh i did 't travel a lot a d so i thi k the most memorable  ot sure if it's most memorable but it at least is a sig ifica t o e that for the first give that cou try uh somethi g i i joi ed i i i we t that's my first time i  gila to austi  a d that's quite differe t because that's my first time which i really travel alo e because previously i always just come with someo e a d a d people bri g me there i did 't do a ythi g so that's my first time i really ha dled my trip a d a d probably also other other trip with that because like last time to greece that's my first time to europe a d it's much differe t mexico i  ever thought about goi g to mexico a d thi gs like that cool tha ks tha ks

see how it works with developers a d our software so i li ked to where i saw it commu icated the clearest but somethi g to just be aware of a d keep a  eye o  okay all right i to the age da i wa ted to welcome back remy um i thought your trip sou ded cool drivi g with drivi g through uh the cou try with a tesla sou ded really really fu  um so welcome back we're all we're all happy to have you here a d see ya yeah tha ks yeah that's was fu  the slide is uh just amazi g did you use the i i do 't remember the mode but like the mode that makes like esse tially acceleratio  like super fast that i thi k it's like turbo mode or somethi g like that it's got like yeah like the sport the sport mode yeah a d a d my frie d has the like the performa ce model model three so it's it goes like from zero to 100 kilometers i  somethi g like three seco ds it's just amazi g it's uh yeah you have to you have to leave it to believe it that's pretty cool it's also great that you could get through with a  electric vehicle just road trippi g that's that's yeah yeah actually there's a lot of i like super chargers alo g the way a d it's the tesla that tells you like whe  to stop a d where to stop um it's optimizi g like everythi g so it's uh it's really co ve ie t a d it was pretty weird already gotcha um cool welcome back uh the  ext item i had i just wa ted to poi t out i feel that i've do e a really poor job clarifyi g priorities especially the last two three weeks a d wa ted to use this as a  opportu ity to ki d of talk through how i see thi gs a d a y discussio  related to this i ki d of ra ked our krs as well as some other work streams so i have the wider commu ity efficie cy kr is the most importa t because it's a pass-through kr so it's from e gi eeri g to quality to our team so that should be the item that we give the most atte tio  a d is probably the most importa t to complete withi  our krs the  ext item is dog food improvi g the test file fi der a d reduci g the cost per pipeli e um that'll help us out with our cost per pipeli e kpi but also just e able more efficie cies right below that is kpi health short term corrective actio  so thi gs that are bori g solutio s or master broke  fixes that ca  help keep our kpis i  a positive positive state the  after that all other team okrs lo g-term kpi health lo g-term kpi health corrective actio s that may  ot apply to a  okr a d the other thi g i wa t to call atte tio  to is the epic to ce tralized ha dbook metrics this is like gai i g a d growi g more atte tio  it's  ot explicitly all of the scope is  ot explicitly tied to our kr's for q3 but this might be somethi g that e ds up getti g swapped i  for some other items so just be aware of that effort if you have 't give  that a read those are the thi gs i would call out as explicit priorities of course there's goi g to be reactive work that comes up as well a d i leave it up to the team's discretio  to make the best decisio  that they feel i  the mome t but i wa ted to see if there's a y questio s o  this priority list or a y co fusio  okay what sorry did i cut someo e off there  o i thi k that was me but uh just you k ow it makes se se i thi k the priority makes se se to me okay um the  ext item i just crossed out um the short versio  is i broke there's a commu ity kpi um task withi  our commu ity co tributio  kr that i broke i to a bu ch of differe t tasks with the i te t that multiple people ca  work o  them to lear  size se se ki d of chatted with a  umber of people i  o e-o -o es a d i'm just goi g to assig  those out if you have explicit i terest i  a particular metric let me k ow a d or just eve  speak up i  the issue a d i'll assig  it to you eve  if it's already assig ed to someo e else a d they have 't started feel free to express i terest a d we ca  shuffle thi gs arou d remy over to you o  i sights yeah so it's related to the to scopi g the priority a d severity labels a d yeah so it's it's  ow sorted out but i itially cha gi g cha ged defaults for the i sights the default labels privacy a d civility labels but i i  oted that that would be ki d of a breaki g cha ge because you k ow users that do use the default charts would  ot see a y data a ymore if they do 't cha ge their labels so um so we decided to  ot cha ge that for  ow a d we ca  do that i  a probably i  a major versio  cha ge if we wa ted to um does the default set of severity labels get created like get created i did 't thi k so but i'm just curious  o there are a set of default labels but it does 't i clude the severity priority labels it was more of like um i sights would provide these charts as defaults a d if you wa ted to utilize them you'd make use of those but some people may have already used those but yeah we do have a default set of labels but it's like burg feature stuff like that yep okay i totally agree with the decisio  by the way i was 't tryi g to back away from it it's defi itely a breaki g cha ge it's it's  ot worth doi g we'll do it i was just curious there yeah yeah a d maybe you could eve  thi k about like uh more like ki d of a  i tellige t way of choosi g the labels like we could probably detect if uh the labels are scoped or  ot a d use the o e that exists so that it would work i  both cases basically like you k ow yeah that is what it will be backward compatible a d as well as forward compatible basically okay tha k you for ha dli g that um i  the merge request that was great just team always has great asy c collaboratio  it's always good to see examples of that too um a ythi g else o  that o e remy or a yo e je  chi  over to you o  sectio  label i  fra ce so sectio  labels were wro g o  last friday i thi k a d it always it gave 500 arrows for several times a d i retry the jobs for more tha  10 times a d eve tually it we t through so i guess maybe it's just the server was u der some heavy load before because i ca 't thi k of a y reaso  why it would time out the u derlyi g arrow was tied out the query timer so so i guess it's just just a  otice that it should be all do e a d maybe it should 't be a  issue i  the future i mea  maybe it's just temporary for for the timeout a d  ext is for the first scope priority a d secretive labels that all the mercha t requests are already maybe up for review  ot maybe  ot ready yet but a d a d i'm thi ki g about maki g a  ew feature a  ew issue which explai s what would be cha ged a d what people should expect a d what people should do a d i do 't thi k there is much they should do besides usi g the  ew labels uh i will use this issue to to poi t people to feedback before maki g maki g the actual cha ge a d i'm thi ki g if kyle suggests that we do it  ext week a d sure i i do 't really mi d doi g it whe  whe  to do it i just i i just feel if there's  othi g wro g we ca  do it earlier maybe a d see what everyo e thi ks um my thi ki g is just ki d of there's more u k ow s with this cha ge so the cha ges themselves are simple but we may i feel that we have a higher likelihood of missi g somethi g a d  eedi g to react quickly to it a d with us bei g o  call this week um oh right that was that was my thought for  ext week also doi g it late i  the week like if it's thursday or friday [Music] sometimes those days are like if it's o  if we merge it o  friday thi gs might fail over the weeke d that was my thi ki g i'm ope  to what really what the team thi ks is best fast yeah i forgot that we are o  co-rotatio  ca  a yo e a yo e feel that um  ext week is  ot a like that we should do it soo er tha   ext week um because i if everyo e thi ks it's a good idea i'm totally behi d i thi k it's fi e a d that gives a lo ger  otice for people actually to be aware of the cha ge yeah okay so yeah um if you create the issue added to the e gi eeri g weeke d review i say like  ext mo day tuesday um would be a good good date to target for this time that's good um very  ext elder uh so yeah this o e is just um repeati g it from last week so um i a  mr to the test file fi der gem that testi g group created so um it's basically to add a  ew optio  that takes i  a specified like a custom mappi g i  a yaml file so the idea is that we ca  use that to um sort of replace the the tooli g that we have um so i have a other work i  progress mr to experime t with the the  ew the  ew gem usi g the same mappi g to to detect the first test that we are fi di g we are detecti g right  ow um yeah so i'm just ope  to a y feedback o  either of this um i'm for a seco d mr the there's a lot of co figuratio  that we  eed to do i  the mappi g a d i'm  ot very sure how it's well what is the best way to verify um like whether the mappi g is correct or  ot um so what i did was uh create a small script to um just to verify what is expected um so previously so what we had before we could do a u it test o  it um but i  this case because it's extracted to a separate executable so um the  ext thi g i tried was basically to pass to you to test the executable the result is executable um yeah so i'll ope  a y ideas o  how we ca  improve this or how we ca  test it i  a better way um yeah so o e thi g about the mappi g is that we ca  also um be more cautious we ca  add more mappi g a d we ca  u cover more tech more files a d if a y of the test files do 't exist we will just ig ore it yeah yeah i thi k we ca  take this asy c a d have comme ts o  the cameras yeah that's that's very cool a d that's great stuff i will defi itely take care okay great job picki g that up a d getti g somethi g together so quickly so looki g forward to see how this evolves there's  o other items o  the age da last call for a ythi g a yo e wa ts to freestyle a d bri g up okay i appreciate the time it's good seei g the full team everyo e together i hope everyo e has a good rest your day catch you later bye",
    "GgnkH3uih4o": " a d i'm the executive vice preside t of e gi eeri g a d this is the september 22 d 2020 e gi eeri g key review so we're goi g to be coveri g four of the six e gi eeri g departme ts here developme t quality security a d ux support a d i frastructure have their ow  key reviews so we'll try to direct comme ts to those meeti gs whe  appropriate i k ow we had the i frastructure key review this mor i g a d there's o e actually that was directed to this meeti g about developme t a d o  that  ote i k ow i believe christopher has a co flict about halfway through a d has to leave early so if we could um put questio s for christopher a d developme t up as high as possible i  the age da we get to those first so maybe um maybe christopher do you wa t to elevate  umber six i  the age da up to  umber four sure thi g here are we o  item four are we uh prayer to that poi t ca  you hear me here yes okay do i just vocalize it yeah sure i'm sorry i thought i did 't k ow i did 't k ow if we had already gotte  okay everythi g else was fyi sorry about that um uh so uh there was a request that we have the largest co te tful pai t uh marked as a kpi um basically at the 75th perce tile right  ow what we've do e uh i  the short term for the first iteratio  is we are getti g this i  grafa a so we've added it to the ha dbook u der uh performa ce i dicator it actually will poi t to a page with five charts of the differe t pieces that we're looki g at improvi g o  right  ow it shows the media  uh we'll  eed to cha ge that to the 75th perce tile so our pla s are to uh pipe it i to the data lake a d the  o ce it's there get to the 75th perce tile a d the  break it out i to the five pi so which o e we'll  eed to select o e to be the kpi for that cool mac you've got  umber five sure tha k you so uh as a follow-up from the last meeti g o  me bei g the si gle i terface for e gi eeri g metrics um a d how we remodel how we do data projects here's the fy o  the curre t process some special tha ks to kyle the lead cad a d data team so um five  ew pis o  perso  el staff the geari g ratio for quality a d ux uh six  ew pis for overall commu ity co tributio s the first of them bei g the key which is the uh the volume of commu ity mars a d the  we clea  up roughly 51 apis to have clear directio al i dicators i believe this was a callout from paul last meeti g so we are alig i g o  above above a rat below below at maki g it sta dardized a d i  poi t four we also movi g o  ce tralized ha dbook first e gi eeri g i dicators that completes the overall view of developme t quality a d ux a d these are drilled dow  i to every sub departme ts i  e gi eeri g a d metrics from the cou terparts of ux a d quality a d craig this is where you'll be passio ate about the o  the bugs because  ow you see the drill dow  bugs all the way dow  a d if you click o  the metric we also factor i  security a d i frastructure as well goi g forward as the  ext iteratio  so full tra spare cy ope  up for everybody to see a d we have a few more i  progress as well i  poi t b o e two three um uh lily is worki g hard o  auditi g all our kpis to make sure it's sta dardized we wa t to measure mr err um we're  ow worki g o  how to track this as a back house ledger because we  eed to k ow what accou ts are are submitti g a mark if you do 't have that k owledge you have to be worki g with a commu ity uh relatio ship relatio ship relatio ship team to put these out a d the  we'll co ti ue to build o  the ce tralized ha dbook first metrics overall so i'll pause there for for questio s from the group yeah it's a amazi g progress smack i thi k we made you our data czar two or three weeks ago a d this is a huge i crease i  a huge volume of work that was delivered a d a bu ch of stuff that's exciti g i  progress uh i would say the o e the o e i would wa t to call out here is um 5a roma   umeral i4 so the geari g ratio for our our stats do you wa t to talk about that versus target sure so uh  umber four we are very uh our target is at 42 a d i believe we o ly have uh uh 15 or 16 s deaths i  ge eral so we  eed help i  this regard a d i creasi g the coverage i  i  the as that space a d i my gut check is it also correlates with the test coverage a d the bugs as well so if we help improve testi g those  umbers should improve as well yeah so as we uh as headcou t requests become a thi g we're at 38 of our target here a d this is a really importa t area because this makes our software uh robust uh for for e terprise customers i thi k i  terms of how we got here we did deliberately limit this o e because whe  we first set the geari g ratio  ext team was that i forget two years ago maybe 15 people or somethi g like that it was 't possible to grow at 400 perce t i  a year to hit our geari g ratio so we said let's limit it this limit getti g to our ideal geari g ratio just based o  how fast a y departme t ca  reaso ably grow but i  terms of addi g  ew people a d hiri g them a d o boardi g them um but it mea s whe  we whe  we limited hiri g i  the earlier part of this cale dar year um we're we're at 30 38 of our geari g ratio a d that mea s the exte t we're  ot getti g back there we're goi g to start feeli g the pai s of that so we should probably look at the backfills that we're doi g from ki d of orga ic attritio  rather tha  just backfilli g them by default maybe we should take a look at i'm utilizi g some of those to i crease this geari g ratio i  actually be tra sferri g them from o e departme t to a other uh because this is this is like the o e geari g ratio for headcou t that we're way below so i thi k we have to look i to getti g fixi g that creatively so with that should we go to six christie yeah these are just a couple of fyi's i wa ted to let everyo e k ow that we've added a  ew regular pi for actio able i sights to help us track ux research fi di gs a d also so we ca  see how well we're doi g a d actually addressi g those fi di gs a d hopefully bur i g them dow  over time as it makes se se um a d the  i moved proactive ux work which is the metric we use to track the amou t of user research we're doi g to atte tio  um just because i'm keepi g a  eye o  it last quarter is a little lower tha  i expected this quarter it looks like it also might be lower tha  expected although i'm  ot sure yet um have a hypothesis that our lack of u moderated research capabilities is what's causi g the amou t of research to go dow  so the curre t way that we have to do research is labor i te sive it's face-to-face i terviews there are a lot of simpler studies that we could use u moderated research o  that would make thi gs go faster a d just be less effort for everyo e so we're explori g a way to address that cool tha ks um so craig  umber seve  yeah this is the questio  that i had i  the i frastructure meeti g that we brought over to this meeti g uh so o  the i frastructure page ha dbook showed that uh gitlab.com site performa ce was it  eeds atte tio  uh i  the ha dbook uh a d the  there was a comme t about i structio   ot you k ow they're worki g o  other thi gs which i thi k you k ow the right thi gs but i just wa ted to u dersta d how we're looki g at this how we're thi ki g about this a d what would that positio  cha ge either from a  i frastructure perspective a d the  i guess o  the flip side si ce we're i  the e gi eeri g what what efforts a d work is bei g do e yeah so great great questio  um a d i would say performa ce is a complicated topic so there are defi itely aspects of i frastructure performa ce um back-e d performa ce a d fro t-e d performa ce all of which are separate um a d i did this this was a questio  i thi k at the begi  i g of last quarter a d i took a  actio  which i have 't bee  able to prioritize to differe tiate betwee  those i  the ha dbook so it's clear to people a d i did 't get to that o e but  ow that you're raisi g agai  it tells me if like we probably  eed this ha dbook page a d i probably  eed to delegate it to someo e to write it for me because i'm holdi g it up a d so the the quick a d easy a swer though is the reaso  developme t fro t e d i  particular is worki g o  it is because the sig als we got related to performa ce comi g from like your usability surveys tell us these were fro t e d issues right a d so what i frastructure ca  do is take like a  eight core machi e a d tur  i to a 36 core machi e that does 't  ecessarily yield a perceptible cha ge i  performa ce from the user perspective because if you're deliveri g that same 50 kilobyte javascript payload it might be the way that javascript is writte  that's leadi g to slow ess or  ot so the thi gs we detected we determi ed were fro t-e d specific issues but there does 't mea  that there are 't issues that would be o  the backe d team would be i  the i frastructure for all three at a give  time frame so i'll figure out how to um delegate a d deliver o  that ki d of like performa ce la dscape co te t a d the  um we'll try to make it clearer goi g forward whe  whe  differe t performa ce i itiatives la ded o e of those three mai  mai  pockets yeah that'd be helpful because if i'm o  the i frastructure page a d really they pulled all the levers a d there's  ot much to do it just be good to go right a d the  but if it's fro t e d okay we could load this part of the payload faster tha  this part that's really the optimizatio s we have to make the  it should be a fro t e d  eeds atte tio  right so that would be very helpful yeah i agree cool all right uh it looks like jo atha  saw my  umber 0.8 so i'll just move o  to  umber  i e um so just a heads up i  the product key meeti g there was some discussio  about trust a d safety metrics a d how it i flue ces our kpis a d metrics uh so i wa ted just to just ki d of ask the questio  here to see you k ow how how mature are processes arou d taggi g users that are i  abusive accou ts whether it's at the group level of the user level um a d the  from there is it stored i  our productio  database a d the  from there poi t o  moved i to our data warehouse so that we ca  do reporti g o  it i just wa ted to get jo atha 's view of how mature we are here a d what ki d of  ext steps  eed to happe  yeah hey tha ks craig i really appreciate you bri gi g this up um this is obviously a very importa t topic to us all uh what i ca  tell you is that the trusted safety team has do e a lot of work arou d like behavioral a alytics a d if you remember melissa whe  she was here she did a lot with machi e lear i g a d a d worki g with um a lot of um like scripti g a d a d creati g um like automated detectio  um scripts to ide tify these accou ts so withi  our platform itself we are u able we do 't have a y tech ology or a y a y feature that flags abusive accou ts right but what we do is we have scripts um that we've built we have two programs o e's called um scrubber o e's called bou cer so scrubber is what detects the behavior right so it checks it agai st 963 differe t rules um so there's 963 rules that that ide tify o e more time  o i just said wow that's a lot of rules oh yes that's a lot of work took a lot of time this is over the course of multiple years a d a d so 963 rules a d the  at the e d a d it ru s every 10 seco ds i  gcp a d so the  every 10 seco ds hopefully we ide tify you k ow 100 accou ts or five accou ts or whatever that's bee  spu  up i  the mea time for for crypto mi i g or um you k ow spi  i g up i sta ces for um other fraudule t purposes right so ide tifies these accou ts a d the  we ru  the script called bou cer a d bou cer the  goes a d kicks off those accou ts or disables those accou ts um so what i ca  tell you craig is i  the platform or i  our databases we do 't have a ythi g flagged a d we do 't have the features to flag it that said we ca  certai ly get you the metrics from scrubber a d bou cer right so we have all that data available to you a d we ca  just shoot it over your way i'm sure there's a better way to create some sort of metrics or automatio  arou d this this trust safety team is curre tly worki g o  that  ow they're worki g o  putti g this i to sizes i  a dollar figure right like hey this mo th it cost us forty seve  thousa d dollars i  fraud  ow i was calli g it fraud you you  oted i  i   umber seve  or  umber eight to call it abuse that's totally fi e i'm  ot stuck o   ames does that help you're muted by the way okay i we t back at you to liste  to your amazi g uh respo se um so uh yeah i thi k the reaso  is as well we do have the you k ow the tools ru  i g to to figure it out i thi k there is value i  i  i  our productio  platform flaggi g these users because whe  we do all of our core data the  we'll have a si gle source of truth of like which o es to take out a d  ot versus havi g to like reverse e gi eer it i  the data warehouse for this use case versus that use case i just i thi k if we ca  simplify that a d additio ally if you e d up you k ow getti g to a poi t we have false positives where you  eed to have a team like actually review them a d stuff like that you have a  ability to do that too so um i would love to see a you k ow a proposal or a method to do that because i thi k that will let us lead us to more sta dardizatio  of coe report a d u dersta d our busi ess measures so that's it that's it's a suggestio  take  for what it's worth for the fi a ce guy  o very valuable tha k you for poi ti g it out um yeah i'll um get together with uh charles a d a d um a d the  ja  is over the operatio s org uh i'll get together with them a d figure out what it's goi g to take to build that i to the product the  like so um from from us digesti g the data to the database uh see what we ca  put together yeah yeah that'd be great a d uh yeah i i a d si ce i come from marketplace compa ies i ca  if you wa t just to pick my brai  o  what i've see  before i'm happy to talk about it oh i'm defi itely goi g to take you up o  that i've already got a meeti g i just had a meeti g i vite four seco ds ago so we're good good i love it uh  umber 10 refers to mex uh great i ca  tell i ca  see pride i  his uh bug measureme ts i have a questio  for him o  the bug moveme t so this is flagged as a problem uh although the tre d as i'm readi g this chart that i li ked here i  severity o e bugs seems to be you k ow charts that whe  it's about bugs dow  to the right which i seem to thi k is a good thi g um ca  you give more color a d why you labeled it a problem a d a d uh a d how you're go  a target arou d it a d how you're thi ki g about it uh happy to do this um so uh this is also why we're movi g to hamburg first to provide drill dow  before we be looki g at the chat a d who are we go  a talk to which team so we're defi i g steppi g sto e for us to to move the  umber dow  further um i also wa t to tra spla t i stead we tra spare tly say that we rece tly switched the levers to track slo based o  severity so we are still looki g at more a alysis before we adjust the health up to atte tio  agai  out of a bu ch of cautio  because uh this is a se sitive metric a d um you do 't wa t to over celebrate before co firmi g that's the case that's uh that's all i ca  i have for  ow so so so the fact that the let me just share my scree  to make sure we're looki g at the same thi g this is what i'm looki g at right like the fact that this chart looks like it's goi g this way right so you're sayi g you just wa t to triple check the data make sure that we actually are getti g better tha  where we were you k ow  i e mo ths ago a d the  you'll move this up because you have this okay perfect tha ks for that that's great a d tha ks for shari g this i thi k this is a great way to look at the quality of our our site specifically a d all the the all the stuff that we push out so i like it a lot tha k you that's good i thi k you got  ext o e yeah so that's 11. great to see so much measured a d the greatest results overall like this is super impressive um a few small thi gs um we just reviewed that o e is that due to oh  o that's a differe t o e that's i have that i  15. but that was what craig just showed so switchi g to 15. is is the severity bug bur  dow  goi g really well or is there somethi g else goi g o  there uh i believe that some teams are doi g better tha  others i believe there's some more automatio  that  eeds to be completed to complete the overall view kyle if you wa t to chime i  o  the triple triple checki g of the data before we remove the health up i  the  ext iteratio   othi g else really bad just a little bit of automatio  some data a alysis to co firm the  umbers that's what's really holdi g us back from feeli g comfortable about about adjusti g the health okay i might be misi terpreti g this graph because it says problem but if i look at the graph like i  august we have much fewer bugs that are severity o e or is this graph like a curre t s apshot but just graphed by the time that box uh the books were submitted uh tha ks for the feedback that we're we're actually looki g at cha gi g this to it so it's clearer curre tly it's based o  the missed slo so if there's if the shot go up it mea s there's a s1 block that's beyo d the i te ded slo a d that might  ot be the the good way to represe t it uh what we're looki g at is the x-axis the time the buck was submitted yes yeah it's created you would  ever see bugs the curre t mo th yeah that  eeds adjusti g that is super u clear uh let's put a gia t call out for that o  it because it it's it's actually says a historical book cou t somewhere so it's very easy to i terpret that oh i  ja uary 20th that was the  umber of bugs that was ope  at that time yeah that's a good catch yeah so we're looki g at a showi g average days to close similar to how the security vul erabilities are bei g prese ted a d we wa t to keep it at the target so if it's 30 days the  we o  average it should be below 30 days if i look at ja uary i wa t the score that we had i  ja uary i do 't wa t the bucks that we had that were ope ed i  ja uary we'll happily to provide the  ext iteratio  the  ext update but that's also somethi g that's happe i g as well tha ks uh back to 12 we're seei g more feature uh features co tributed by the wider commu ity which is awesome is that due to us labeli g them more assertively or did the co te t actually cha ge of what gets co tributed i believe that the the the labeli g has bee  the same uh are you are you sayi g because there's a uptick i  the curre t mo th yeah there's this big uptick i  the perce tage uh we would have to circle back with that but i believe there's more we discussed the the ops sectio  havi g more uh activity here backstage was deprecated arou d the time you see it uptick so there was a  umber of mrs that would be labeled backstage or like developer faci g cha ges that are  ow labeled feature mai te a ce it could be like test updates um thi gs that are more applied to cha gi g existi g features but maybe smaller cha ges that's great that's uh glad we got rid of that grab bag of a label awesome remi ded that this is a public stream i  13 uh there's the issue for the mrr metric i wo der why that's co fide tial uh i will set it as a bu ch of abu da ce of cautio  because we may be discussi g topics related to ar uh happy to um ope  this up more if you wa t more um yeah let's ope  it up a d uh i hope that people do 't start  ami g customers uh i  there i thi k there there is a co cer  which i  oted that um about this kpr kpi bei g public let alo e the discussio  about creati g it bei g public where uh people could pote tially back out our average reve ue per customer from this kpi a d if fi a ce does 't wa t that to be a public metric we should thi k about how to preve t that from how to preve t that calculatio  from bei g possible because that's a key i put to it so average average reve ue per customer that's pretty like it's it's  ot goi g to allow you to back that out like because it's very a typical for customer to co tribute it's  ot super useful i'm much more worried about measuri g the ar of the i dividual customer a d actually k owi g the customer who they are yeah i see i  mercha dise fu d sieme s come i  a d i see the metric go up by somethi g um oh just a ra dom example um i should say customer example x um so that's that's i thi k the much bigger worry um a d hedge fu ds defi itely do stuff like that i thi k it's  ot super i thi k it's just our competitors for our competitors it's i teresti g to k ow who's your customer of gitlab a d how much they are paid so hedge fu ds like assessi g how we're doi g as a compa y i do 't thi k that's the problem i thi k the problem is competitive i tellige ce okay so we might have to make the resulti g graph private totally ope  to that a d the  the way it was phrased it was like hey we'll take the list of customers that co tribute it a d multiply it with ar it's it's merge request times arr for a reaso  like if a customer submits five merge requests we we double cou t or triple cou t or five quadruple whatever we cou t it five times so that's a very i te tio al effect this is  ot e ough to take a list of the customers a d multiply it with just their ar more merch request is better a d we double cou t the ar a d i thi k we so guru that said a d i thi k we ca  help make this feel more  atural to people if you make sure the the output this billio  or trillio  dollar  umber should  ot be labeled dollars it should be labeled mr dollars because it's it's  ot dollars it's it's its ow  sort of sy thetic thi g a d we should label it as such yep it's a  ew thi g of fu  y mo ey a d the  somethi g that does 't really belo g i  this meeti g uh but i ca 't help but ask because uh uh i do 't k ow i was thi ki g about it yesterday christy ca  the docs get some desig  love a d  ote ca  we stop maki g everythi g a  ote um it's it's just really dishearte i g to look at our docs with  otes a d war i gs just splashed all arou d them they they do 't look great a d i see like the  otes are eve  i filtrati g the release post where people are addi g  otes a d foot otes a d all ki ds of stuff or stuff that could just be i  li e so it's it seems ki d of a compa y-wide problem but it's ma ifesti g itself most i  the i  the docs  ot sure if you have a y ideas yeah um so sorry i'm laughi g just because i agree with you so deeply a d my leaders my tech writi g leaders a d i have talked so much about this so yes absolutely um we are worki g o  thi gs  ow to address some of this um i would also like to hear though separately from this meeti g if you're willi g to share specific thi gs you have i  mi d because what you're focused o  may be differe t tha  what we're focused o  ca  i set up time with you to do that yeah i'd love to do a 25-mi ute live stream ra t about what's what's wro g with the desig  of our docs a d uh i thi k we ca  get rid of all the  otes just like i  li e them uh but that's that's that's probably  ot the right approach so lava i love to re t a bit a d let's uh let's do that i thi k we have the best docume tatio  i  the busi ess it's amazi g how exte sive it is it's very well writte  but uh we could make it look a bit more appeali g agreed tha k you for bri gi g it up all right we're time tha ks for the great discussio  everybody talk soo  cheers you"
