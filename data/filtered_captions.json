    "rOqgRiNMVqg": "So, this is the security, governance, growth, and data science meeting applied to ML, ML Ops, and the anti-abuse team meeting. I have a lot of things on the agenda today. I'll work on doing more summarized communications to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in my communications to groups of people, including this group. I am going to assume that people, leaders on the team, will attend this meeting or read the notes and not rely on the slack channel.\n\nThe Anti-Abuse team is moving product sections from security to data science. Data science will include two stages, the existing model Ops which has three groups in it, and the Anti-Abuse stage, which currently has only one group called Anti-Abuse. There are plans to split Anti-Abuse into two groups in the future, but we're working through all the changes around that. Mom, did you want to say anything more about data science or Model Ops? Oh, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, so everything else stays the same. We still have the two main groups, Model Ops, and the later data ops as part of it.\n\nThanks, Thomas, for continuing to compile and report out on all of my teams that I'm responsible for, engineering allocations, error budgets, reliability, and security incidents. Gotta give Neal a high-five too! He does half of these now! And apologies for the noise if I keep asking for what's the story behind what's going on with reliability or security or error budget stuff. Just trying to provide cover. And apologies, Neal, I totally forgot you took half a day since Thomas has been doing it for so long. But appreciating you. Thank you.",
    "Tmd5eKVgySY": "Data science staff meeting we're going to discuss the non-confidential things. Looks like Nate, you have the first item. Just a bit of news about new hires, the compliance group has a senior front-end engineer joining on November 28th. We noted this in slack last week but it's worth repeating here, so we've got a four-year work anniversary and a three-year work anniversary one for first Versatia, the to garage. Best in Class bi also known as bicokrs for securing Governor being finalized for Q4 by product management with a ETF Distributing them by the end of this week. Please be sure to engage on them ASAP as we want to accomplish the ones slated 4Q4 in Q4 wherever feasible. Continue to give PM feedback and ask questions about the okrs and the associated epics and issues to make sure we understand the goals and ways to deliver them as iteratively and effectively as possible. TL;DR is we're talking with our product managers, what work have you got coming up for us in Q4 that you've already prioritized that relates to Best in Class.",
    "JwBNYjaEwmQ": "This is the SEC growth data science staff meeting for January 18th. Welcome, George, who's my shadow this week and a GitLab core community contributor. On the agenda, we have a discussion about personal access tokens being automatically revoked for all GitLab core team members. Then, we reviewed draft Q10 OKRs for Secure, Gather, Governance, Growth, and Data Science. There were discussions about increasing revenue, maturing the platform, and focusing on career growth of team members. Wayne pointed out a duplication in the objectives and it was corrected. The meeting also touched on volunteer opportunities for audit work efforts and a thank you for participation in the weekly error budget issues. George discussed the lack of community contributions in the secure, governance, growth, and data science stages and suggested moving some features to open core to increase contributions. There was also a discussion about providing ultimate licenses to core contributors as soon as they start contributing. George shared his approach to identifying opportunities to contribute, focusing on migration initiatives and community contributions.\n\nThanks everybody, have a great day.",
    "Y33pKPUamCQ": "The capacity for UX research and communicating it to PM's was discussed in the last session. There were multiple views and different perspectives on how to manage this. The outcome was that it's important to communicate capacity to PM's and find a good way to do that. There were still thoughts regarding this, so the topic was moved to this session.\n\nThere was a discussion on how to report capacity to PM's at different stages. It was realized that there may be a lack of mechanisms to report this capacity effectively. It was suggested to be more communicative and share issues synchronously with PM's. Another idea was to inform PM's at the beginning of the week about current workload.\n\nThe idea of filtering columns for problem validation, design workflow, design validation, and workflow solution validation instead of filtering for a milestone was discussed. Assignees could be filtered down to continuous integration, planning breakdown, or scheduling. This simplified way of looking at issues helps in identifying available spots for work.",
    "kGHyK_SkZB0": "Engineering Topic:\n...My item, there is a pretty big and rather radical change from the cicd private catalog. So we discussed this a lot and this came up and inspired me a lot while I did the journey map exercise, and I didn't feel it's right to have this private cicd catalog scope her namespace because we have interviewed several self-management customers. It could be really multiple namespaces. I'm not going to disclose the exact number but it could be a lot, of course, it depends on the organization's side and how Dove announced this change and this will impact a bit of our product roadmap or the timeline. Design-wise, the impact is not that big, but I think this is the right way to go...So, I will start working on how users are using GitLab and the cloud. \n\nCI/CD UX Topic:\n...I think we landed on the stats. Yeah, but either way, I think they would at least be interested in that...\n\nData Science Topic:\n...So, I am just analyzing all the sessions from how do we use AI to help users optimize their Runner and CI builds, and it was pretty cool. We used a decision tree process from this book on AI that I'm reading, and basically, the idea is if you can put the decisions into clear if-then statements, then you have support that you can automate this workflow a bit...And the process is very trial and error and set it and forget it. That's the main thing...So, I think that's like one of our CI learnings...",
    "HFEFQ4NcgSQ": "We could simplify things by focusing on fostering async communication and updates between engineers and UX to document everything better, creating a shared understanding and making information more accessible. This process change is expected to solve many problems and align the team effectively.",
    "qGFoZ8yodc4": "Engineering Key Review at GitLab\n\nProposal to break up the meeting into four departments: engineering, development quality, security, and UX infrastructure and support for their own key reviews. The reasons being to increase visibility, go deeper, increase objectivity, allow more time to focus on new markets, and shift into more of a question-asker mode. To avoid adding more meetings to stakeholders' calendars, a two-month rotation is proposed, with development quality for month one, security for month two, and UX for month three. \n\nDiscussion on R&D overall MR rate and R&D wider MR rate as top-level KPIs for engineering. Clarification on the difference between them - wider MR rate includes community contributions only, while overall MR rate includes both internal and external MRs. Conversation on the potential duplication and the need to clarify the measurement of wider MR rate. Proposed shift to tracking the percentage of total MRs coming from the community over time instead. \n\nConcerns raised about the PostgreSQL replication issue and the need to focus on addressing constraints in replication. Discussion on the need for a dedicated host, tuning performance improvements, and handling conflicting queries affecting replication. Collaboration between data engineering and infrastructure teams to address the issue.\n\nUpdates on defect tracking against SLOs, with a focus on improving the percentage of defects meeting SLOs. Discussion on the spike in meantime to close for S2s and potential factors contributing to it, such as changing severity levels for MRs. \n\nFurther discussions on improvements in SLOs, bug metrics measurement, and the need to prioritize security work. Context provided for the lower MR rate, with factors like vacation days and power outages in Texas impacting productivity. Expectations for a rebound in activity in the coming months.\n\nOverall, the meeting focused on key topics related to engineering, development quality, and security, with a goal of improving processes and metrics within the company.",
    "t-NF5fNOyo8": "In the spirit of Remy coming back, I thought it would be fun to talk about a memorable trip or vacation people have taken. Mine, I think I will remember this for quite some time. In March, when I went to Aruba with my wife, it was right as the pandemic was starting and we kind of were waffling about going. It was great, Aruba is like an island in the Caribbean, so beaches, sun, things that we don't get to experience around here. Super fun! But as we came back, that was when everything was shutting down in the US, and that's pretty much our only memory of the trip, is we came back and the pandemic was unfolding in the US.\n\nUm, about me, I love road trips and I did some road trips with one of my best friends a few years ago. We went to Canada, in the Quebec part of Canada, and we did I don't know how many, but like four or five national parks. So hiking, obviously, and also we went to see whales in the Saguenay River, basically just between the river and the sea. So, yeah, that's a really cool memory. And the next year, we did another road trip with the same friend in Scotland, and that was also super fun. So, yeah, road trips are always fun. Like this year as well, I went to Italy, that was awesome, but yeah, road trips are always fun.\n\nMy most memorable would be India, so I spent two weeks in India. I think it was maybe about seven years ago now; but that was one of the first trips that I'd taken outside of Europe and it was just amazing. It was so different and just experiencing that for the first time.\n\nYeah, so like four years ago, my wife and I went to Japan, so that was very memorable because we went there for the Tokyo Marathon and the Tokyo Marathon is known to be very difficult to get. So people need to apply and there will be a ballot to tell you whether you get an entry into the race or not, and we both tried on the first attempt and we got it. So it was quite memorable because we know friends who have tried three or four times and they couldn't get an entry at all.\n\nWhat about you, Albert?\n\nI didn't travel a lot and so I think the most memorable... Not sure if it's most memorable but at least it is a significant one that for the first city that I visited outside my country. Something I enjoyed it. I went; that's my first time in Goa, India to Australia. That's quite different because that's my first time which I really traveled alone.\n\nIs it Albert next?\n\nYeah, thanks, yeah, that's was fun. The mode that makes essentially acceleration super fast that I think it's like turbo or something like that, it's got like yeah, like the sport mode. And my friend has the performance model Model 3, so it goes from zero to 100 kilometers in something like three seconds, it's just amazing. You have to leave it to believe it, that's pretty cool. It's also great that you could get through with an electric vehicle, just road tripping that's yeah, actually there's a lot of superchargers along the way, and it's the Tesla that tells you like when to stop and where to stop. It's optimizing like everything so it's really convenient and it was pretty wild already.",
    "GgnkH3uih4o": "We also moved centralized handbook-first engineering indicators that complete the overall view of development, quality, and UX. These are drilled down into every sub-department in engineering, including metrics from counterparts of UX and quality.\n\nIn point B two three, Lily is working hard on auditing all our KPIs to make sure it is standardized. We want to measure Mr. Err. We're now working on how to track this as a backup ledger because we need to know which accounts are submitting a mark.\n\nAs headcount requests become a thing, we're at 38 of our target here, and this is a really important area because this makes our software robust for enterprise customers. I think in terms of how we got here, we deliberately limited this one because when we first set the gearing ratio, our team was not possible to grow at 400 percent in a year to hit our gearing ratio.\n\nMaybe we should take a look at utilizing some of those to increase this gearing ratio by transferring them from one department to another because this is the one gearing ratio for headcount that we're way below. So I think we have to look into fixing that creatively."
